50404, "Kashyyyk has been occupied by the Empire almost as long as there’s been an Empire. The Wookiee home world has served as a steady source of slaves for the Imperial war effort. \n\nConditions on occupied Kashyyyk were tolerable; the Empire was treating the place like a prison colony.  To protect the forests of Kashyyyk from the ravages of battle, the Wookiees were willing to wait the Empire out. With a lifespan of perhaps 300 years, Wookiees could afford to take the long view. \n\nThat’s why Chewbacca was surprised to get a garbled message from his father just after the Battle of Endor.  Something big was happening on Kashyyyk, and Attichitcuk was asking for help. \n\nGet Han and Chewbacca safely to the Wookiee village of Kepitenochan."
50405, "1. Destroying the Trandoshan Prison Buildings will likely free some very angry Wookiees.  They’ll be willing to follow anyone who will lead, especially against the Empire. \n\n2. When faced with overwhelming odds, seek an alternative to combat. \n\n3. Investigate divergent paths on Kashyyyk. You may discover aid in unexpected places."
50406, "Han and Chewie must arrive safely at Kepitenochan."
50407, "Han and Chewie must survive."
50408, "Han Solo: Who are these Trandoshans?"
50409, "Chewbacca:  ROAR!!"
50410, "Get Han and Chewie to the city of Kepitenochan."
50411, "Han Solo: That's Kepitenochan?"
50412, "Weebacca: Graaah!"
50413, "Han Solo: Looks like the Empire had a party here."
50414, "Chewbacca:  Rooaaar!!!"
50415, "Han Solo: We're in over our heads, big guy."
50416, "Han Solo: We've got to get word to the New Republic."
50417, "Han Solo:  A Wookiee Medic!  This should help us out."
50418, "Han Solo: Stay down, Chewie!"
50419, "Chewbacca: Rooaar!"
50420, "Han Solo: The Empire's here alright."
50421, "Chewbacca:  grunt grunt"
50422, "Han Solo: This could be a tough fight, maybe we should find a way around?"
50423, "Weebacca: GraaaAAH!"
50424, "Chewbacca: Roaaar!"
50425, "Han Solo: Weebacca, eh?  I suppose any friend of Chewie's is a friend of mine."
50426, "Han Solo:  There's something not right about that Weebacca."
50427, "Chewbacca:  grunt?"
50428, "Han Solo: We're gonna need to watch out for him."
50429, "Chewbacca: growl"
50430, "Han Solo: What was he doing out by that slave camp by himself?"
50431, "Chewbacca: ROAR!"
50432, "Han Solo: I am not paranoid, you big walking carpet!"
50433, "Han Solo: Where are we Chewie?"
50434, "Chewbacca:  Graaaah!"
50435, "Han Solo: How far away is Kepitenochan?"
50436, "Chewbacca:  grunt growl!"
