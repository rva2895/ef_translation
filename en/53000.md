53002, "Shoran"
53003, "Shoran has established a camp nearby. Once you've found him, begin trading with his camp. \n\nDefend your village against Trade Federation attacks."
53004, "1. Check your buildings for new technologies and units, especially when you reach a new tech level.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAdvanced Tips:\n\nYou can replant a farm quickly by choosing a worker and right-clicking on the depleted farm.\n\nPress the Farm button at your Food Processing Center to queue up multiple farms.

Then you can recall that group by just hitting the number key."
53005, "Congratulations!"
53006, "Our efforts were in vain."
53007, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  The Trade Federation has pressed on despite their losses. Alaris Prime must be a rich world indeed."
53008, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You have one thing that the Trade Federation does not; allies."
53009, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  They have great resources and large armies, but an ally is valuable beyond measure."
53010, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  I’ll show you how to find and interact with allies."
53011, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Put your workers to work while I explain"
53012, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Shoran has set up another camp a short distance from here."
53013, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  If you click the diplomacy button on the upper right corner of your screen, you can see Shoran listed as an ally, and the friendless Trade Federation listed as an enemy."
53014, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  The choices you make on this screen determine whether your troops will fire on the units of another faction...or help them out."
53015, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  First things first.  Have your workers build a Spaceport."
53016, "Build a Spaceport within your camp."
53017, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  With a Spaceport, you can trade with your allies.  You can also buy and sell things from offworld brokers."
53018, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  A very useful upgrade available at your Spaceport is the Holonet Transceiver.  Start researching it now."
53019, "Research Holonet Transceiver at your Spaceport."
53020, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  The holonet transceiver lets you see whatever your allies see.  This opens up areas of the map that you’d otherwise have to explore yourself."
53021, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Now that we know where Shoran is, we can start trading with him."
53022, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Select your Spaceport, and build a cargo hovership."
53023, "Build a cargo hovercraft at your Spaceport."
53024, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Now, select your new cargo hovership..."
53025, "Qui-Gon Jinn: ...and right click on Shoran’s Spaceport to send your hover ship there."
53026, "Send your cargo hovercraft to Shoran's Spaceport to establish a trade route."
53027, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You’ll have to scroll across the map to find Shoran’s Spaceport."
53028, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  It looks just like your Spaceport, but it’s a slightly different color."
53029, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  An ally’s gate will open up when you get near it.  I’ll tell you more about gates later on."
53030, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Your cargo hovership will keep travelling back and forth to your ally’s Spaceport.  On every return trip, some nova crystals will be added to your stockpiles."
53031, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You can send multiple cargo hoverships on one trade route."
53032, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Shoran tells me he found something of interest near his camp.  A Jedi Holocron!"
53033, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  A Holocron is a priceless repository of ancient information! It should not be left lying in the wilderness!"
53034, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  We need to build a Jedi Temple to house the Holocron."
53035, "Qui-Gon Jinn: The Jedi Council has just granted us approval to build a Jedi Temple on Alaris Prime."
53036, "Have your workers build a Jedi Temple now."
53037, "Build a Jedi temple within your camp."
53038, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Now, select the Jedi Temple and click Create Jedi Padawan."
53039, "Create a Padawan at your Jedi temple."
53040, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  This is my Padawan apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi."
53041, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  He still has much to learn about the ways of a Jedi Knight."
53042, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  He can, however, retrieve a Holocron."
53043, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Send your Jedi Padawan to Shoran’s camp to grab the Holocron."
53044, "Send Obi-Wan to Shoran's camp."
53045, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Good, now send—"
53046, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Wait!  Shoran has spotted an excursion of Trade Federation troops!"
53047, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Garrison your workers and ready your fighting Wookiees!"
53048, "Activate the alert beacon and brace for an attack."
53049, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Now send your Jedi Padawan back with the Holocron."
53050, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Select your Jedi Padawan and right click on the Holocron to pick it up."
53051, "Have Obi-Wan bring the holocron back to your camp."
53052, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  The Holocron is here now.  Selecting the Jedi Padawan and right-click on the Jedi Temple"
53053, "Garrison the holocron within your Jedi temple to add Nova crystals to your stockpiles."
53054, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Great work.  We directly benefit from the Holocron’s secrets.  It slowly adds nova crystals to your stockpile."
53055, "Continue gathering resources.  You may also want to experiment with the various upgrades available at your troop center and resources processing centers."
53056, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Shoran’s scouts have discovered an array of Trade Federation listening posts."
53057, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  They are wary of us, keeping tabs on our progress."
53058, "Chewbacca: ROARORARROAROR!"
53059, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Chewbacca suggests we show them our progress by destroying their listening array."
53060, "Prepare an army to destroy the Trade Federation's sentry posts."
53061, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Shoran is gathering a force of troopers in the middle of his camp."
53062, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Build several more military units, too.  We'll need them for future attacks."
53063, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  If you begin the assault on the Trade Federation listening posts, Shoran’s forces will join us."
53064, "Gather your army at Shoran's camp."
53065, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  If you’re still training soldiers, you can set their gather point to be near Shoran’s army."
53066, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  That should be enough military units to do what needs to be done."
53067, "Attack the Trade Federation's sentry posts.  Destroy any Trade Federation that you encounter."
53068, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You’ve won the day again!  Chewbacca's strategies are bearing fruit!"
53069, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Chewbacca is dead!  We must abort the mission!"
53070, "Shoran has perished.  Game over."
53071, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Shoran has asked for some nova crystals to help him recover from the Trade Federation attack."
53072, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  He warned us of the attack – it’s the least we can do."
53073, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Open the diplomacy menu again using the button on the upper right hand corner."
53074, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Then click on the Nova Crystal button to tribute 100 nova crystals to Shoran."
53075, "Use the Alliances menu to tribute 100 Nova crystals to Shoran."
53076, "Shoran:  ROARORRAOROARORAOR!"
53077, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Shoran thanks you.  He’s tributing us some spare metal in return."
53078, "Make sure that Obi-Wan brings the holocron to your camp."
