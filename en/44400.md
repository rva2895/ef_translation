44406, "The Viceroy grows impatient to see our invasion bear fruit.  He desires direct evidence of Naboo's wealth before he will commit to the costly occupation of Theed. \n\nMuch of that wealth is collected in the coastal town of Spinnaker, which has been unable to offload goods since our blockade began. \n\nYou must occupy Spinnaker, replace the Spaceports there with your own, and collect 10000 Nova crystals to present to the Viceroy."

44407, "1. Make sure you have a large enough force before trying to invade the heavily defended coastal town of Spinnaker. \n\n2. Use your own Spaceports to exchange excess resources for Nova. Do not undermine your goal by buying resources at inflated prices! \n\n3. Your nearby ally has a Spaceport. Create and send Cargo Hovercraft there to augment your Nova reserves. \n\n4. You can even send cargo hovercraft to enemy Spaceports, provided you subdue any opposition around them."

44408, "Naboo Villagers:  We surrender!  Please, take whatever you want, just spare us!"

44409, "Royal Naboo Navy:  Enemy vessels!  Leave these waters immediately or we will be forced to fire upon you!"

44410, "Raise 10000 Nova crystals, by gathering resources, selling goods at your Spaceport, and trading with other Spaceports."
