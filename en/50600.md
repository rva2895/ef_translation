50603, "Kepitenochan was in ruins.  While we searched for survivors, our Wookiee allies told us what they knew. Trandoshan slavers had showed up a few days ago and started rounding up every Wookiee they could find.  They stuffed ‘em into pens and began transporting them offworld.  \n\nSeveral Wookiees fought their way free and disappeared into the forest. There were probably hundreds of them out there, trying to figure out where to go.  \n\nChewbacca had an idea: Establish a base on the ruins of Kepitenochan and rebuild the shattered Government Tree.  With the magnificent structure in place, the news would spread fast: The Wookiees were ready to retake Kashyyyk."
50604, "1. Build adequate defenses before completing the Government Tree. The Empire has spies everywhere and will likely be sending an army to destroy it. \n\n2. Search the area for escaped Wookiees among the trees."
50605, "Reconstruct the Wookiee Government Tree."
50606, "Han Solo: O.k., so your Government Tree is restored."
50607, "Han Solo: Now let's hope we can keep it defended against the Empire and the Trandoshans."
50608, "Chewbacca:  *grunt* *growl* Hraaaoo!"
50609, "Han Solo:  How is reconstructing a Wookiee Tree Center helping us to make contact with Lando and Luke?"
50610, "Chewbacca:  ROAAAR!"
50611, "Han Solo: OK! OK!  I'll start building."
50612, "Defend the rebuilt Government Tree for 200 days."
