50202, "In the earliest days of the Rebellion, General Dodonna executed a brilliant defense against a sudden Imperial onslaught.  Working with the limited resources available in a tiny asteroid cluster, and without any hope of reinforcements, he drove back the Imperial forces, then took the fight to them and shattered their base. \n\nNow you will face the same extraordinary challenge.  Eliminate the Imperial presence in the Silken asteroid field"
50203, "1. Killing any of the animals from the nursery is not recommended. If it gets destroyed, build another quickly, before your nerfs die in the thin atmosphere. \n\n2. We will be competing with the Empire for limited resources. You will need to spread out quickly to ensure a steady supply of ore and Nova."

50205, "General Jan Dodonna:  They're attacking the Command Center!"
50206, "General Jan Dodonna: We've lost a shield generator."
