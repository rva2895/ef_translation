54108, "Although the Republic isn't expecting an attack, Sarapin is not without its defenses. A powerful shield protects the planet from invasion.\n\nThe energy for this shield is relayed from a maze-like asteroid field surrounding the system. Count Dooku has supplied General Tann with a force of Air Cruisers to help navigate this dangerous territory. Destroy the power relay on Asteroid 426 in order to collapse Sarapin's shield."
54109, "1. The outer grid is littered with Anti-Air Turrets which you'll have to navigate carefully.\n\n2. Your Air Cruisers will be helpful in clearing areas where they are tightly clustered.\n\n3. The supply depot on the near side of Asteroid 426 is the only place you'll find resources.  Use them to build your base once you've destroyed the depot buildings."
54110, "Destroy the Power Relay on Asteroid 426."
54111, "At least one transport must survive to the landing site."
54112, "[Optional] Destroy the Asteroid Supply Depots to gain additional resources and buildings."
54119, "The outskirts of the Sarapin Defense Grid are made up of small asteroids, with many containing anti-air installations and are patrolled by Republic fighter squadrons.  Further in you'll find Asteroid 426, a large, icy moonlet on which the Power Relay for the Defense Grid rests.  There is a ground force stationed there to protect the Relay, and a supply depot where space transports drop provisions."

54128, "Sarapin now lies before the Confederacy unprotected - but this volatile world still presents many obstacles.\n\nDangerous lava flows and harsh conditions threaten to make our invasion more difficult. The Republic defense forces will not give up without a fight. Sev'Rance Tann must bring all her armies to bear in this operation.\n\nThe main energy repositories are located atop Mt. Corvast - a high volcano surrounded by a thick web of Republic militia.  General Tann will need to punch through their defenses to reach the mountain keep and shut down their operations. This will be a difficult battle, but with the Decimators online Sev'Rance should have the upper hand."
54129, "1. There are four major military installations surrounding Mt. Corvast. The Republic's Army is bristling with anti-air units so a strong ground assault force will be necessary to ensure victory.\n\n2.  You have at your control now the Decimator weapon; take advantage of its awesome power."
54130, "Destroy Mt. Corvast Citadel to capture the energy collection repositories."
54131, "Eliminate the Jedi, Jor Drakas."
54132, "[Optional] Destroy all Republic forces."
54133, "[Optional] Destroy all energy drill platforms."

54148, "The Clone Wars have begun! Following an ambush of the Jedi by the droid army of the Confederacy, Master Yoda has arrived in the nick of time with an overwhelming counter-force of Clone Troopers.\n\nGeneral Echuu Shen-Jon and his Padawan Stam Reath have landed near several Trade Federation Battleship cores.  Mace Windu has ordered Echuu and his forces to sabotage and destroy them before they can escape the planet's surface."
54149, "1. A force of Republic pummels was supposed to be dropped nearby.  If Echuu can find them, they could prove useful against the Battleship cores.\n\n2. The Confederacy is in retreat!  However, Echuu's force is small and reinforcements are unlikely.  Use caution in this mission."
54150, "Destroy the Battleship core to the East."
54151, "Destroy the Battleship core to the South."
54152, "Echuu Shen-Jon must survive."

54157, "Ki-Adi-Mundi must survive."
54159, "Preliminary scans show a concentration of Confederacy defenses in the South, likely guarding the main Battleship core.  A small group of allied units last reported in from a position directly East of the main Battleship core.  Count Dooku was last seen retreating North; his means of escape will likely lie in that direction."

54168, "The Confederacy has struck back. Having penetrated Sarapin's defensive grid, Count Dooku's finest general, Sev'Rance Tann, has shut down operations on this important energy producing planet.\n\nThe Core Worlds are feeling the repercussions of this attack and the Galactic Senate is in an uproar! Many parts of Coruscant are losing power and panic is beginning to grip the populace.\n\nThe Jedi Council must act quickly to restore order before the situation gets out of hand. Mace Windu has assigned General Echuu Shen-Jon and his new Padawan, Naat Reath, to reclaim the world of Sarapin and restore its energy production."
54169, "1. Confederacy camps are spread out among the foothills of Mt. Corvast. You must find some powered-down worker droids and build a force strong enough to complete your mission.\n\n2. Some valuable resources may be hard to come by near your drop site so you'll need to keep moving to find what you need.\n\n3. Once you reclaim Mt. Corvast Citadel you'll need to capture Zian Finnis to learn the whereabouts of Sev'Rance Tann.\n\n4. Now that the Clone Wars have begun, the Jedi are key to the success of the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic. Train many Knights and Masters and have them lead your troops into battle."

54188, "The Confederacy has entered into an unholy alliance with the Hutt Cartel, and established a base of operations on Tatooine. But not all of Boorka's partners are happy with this arrangement.\n\nJabba the Hutt may be willing to deal with the Republic, if he can extricate himself from Confederacy 'entanglements'. With or without Jabba's help, Echuu must find a way to infiltrate that base."
54189, "1. Stay away from Boorka or the Confederacy bases with your initial force.  Wait until you've built up a sizable army before taking them out."
54190, "Meet with Jabba."

54199, "Jabba the Hutt's Sail Barge is parked to the north of your position, he waits to meet with you.  To the northeast lies Jundland Station, a small Tatooine settlement.  Boorka the Hutt and the Confederacy base are likely hidden in the cliffs to the northwest."
