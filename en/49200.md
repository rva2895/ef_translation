49206, "Echuu was reflective as we departed Krant. Leia had suggested that he remain to protect the people of Krant, that she could secure the Vor’Na’Tu by herself.  He replied that he had no choice but to face his destiny. \n\nThe Empire had chosen Geddes, a large asteroid in the Kron drift, to base a secret research facility.  When the Vor’Na’Tu was discovered, it was sent to Geddes to await transport back to Coruscant. \n\nFind out where the Empire is holding the Vor'Na'Tu, then seize it and escape on your Rebel Transport."
49207, "1. A direct frontal attack, though possible, may not necessarily be the best choice. \n\n2. The base is still under construction; look for a hole in its outer defenses. \n\n3. It may be advantageous to split up your forces; have one cause a diversion at the front gate while the other attacks from the rear of the base. \n\n4. The Emperor has twisited his army's will to the dark side.  Any effort to convert them will only result in them taking their own lives."
49208, "The Vorn'Na'Tu has been broken up."
49209, "You failed to capture the Vor'Na'Tu.  In the hands of the emperor it can be used to enhance his already great powers of evil."
49210, "The Empire is waiting for Darth Vader to arrive and take possession of the Vor'Na'Tu, a Force enhancing crystal capable of giving anyone sensitive to the Force great power.  If Darth Vader has an opportunity to get a hold of the crystal it would spell certain doom to the Rebel cause."
49211, "C-3PO: Princess, another spaceship is landing beyond the ridge."
49212, "C-3PO: It is a Wookiee Transport."
49213, "Princess Leia: I thought we might need some help on this operation."
49214, "Princess Leia: So I sent a transmission to my old friend Attichitcuk."
49215, "Princess Leia: He's a very powerful Wookiee chief."
49216, "C-3PO:There are some deactivated explosive droids in that supply yard.  Echuu can convert and reactivate them"
49217, "Princess Leia must survive."
49218, "C-3PO: The Princess is dead."
49219, "Jedi Master Echuu must survive."
49220, "C-3PO: I'm afraid Master Echuu has passed on."
49221, "Destroy the Sith temple holding the Vor'Na'Tu."
49222, "Princess Leia: The temple is destroyed!"
49223, "Echuu must take the Vor'Na'Tu back to the Rebel Transport to escape."
49224, "Attichitcuk must survive."
49225, "C-3PO: I believe Attichitcuk has died."
49226, "Meet with Attichitcuk's Wookiee Troops."
49227, "Attichitcuk: Growl..."
49228, "C-3PO: Attichitcuk sends his greetings."
49229, "Princess Leia: Please tell him I'm glad to have the Wookiee's assistance."
49230, "Attichitcuk: Growl..."
49231, "C-3PO: He says he's ready."
49232, "Princess Leia: Let's go then."
49233, "C-3PO must survive."
49234, "C-3PO: Oh dear - I'm destroyed."
49235, "Find where the Empire is keeping the Vor'Na'Tu."
49236, "Echuu Shen-Jon: It's a Sith Temple."
49237, "C-3PO: There are strange readings coming from inside."
49238, "Echuu Shen-Jon: It's where they have the Vor'Na'Tu."
49239, "Echuu needs to pick up the Vor'Na'Tu."
49240, "Echuu Shen-Jon: I have the Vor'Na'Tu."
49241, "Echuu Shen-Jon: This must never fall into the hands of the Emperor!"
49242, "Echuu Shen-Jon: Escape while you can!"
49243, "[Optional] Have Echuu convert the explosive droids."
49244, "Darth Vader: You have desecrated my Sith Temple."
49245, "Darth Vader: How did you escape the purge, Jedi?"
49246, "Echuu Shen-Jon: Princess, go!"
49247, "Princess Leia: I won't leave you, Echuu!"
49248, "Echuu Shen-Jon: I'll always be with you."
49249, "Echuu Shen-Jon: It had to be broken apart."
49250, "Echuu Shen-Jon: It was too powerful for one Jedi to possess."
49251, "Darth Vader: For that, you will pay dearly."
49252, "C-3PO: Use these droids to disrupt the base and gain a tactical advantage"
49253, "Princess Leia, C-3PO and Jedi Master Echuu must survive."
