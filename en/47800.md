47806, "Vague clues from Reytha have sent Lord Vader to the Outer Rim to search for the Rebel fleet, but the trail is growing cold. \n\nZaloriis, a nearby planet with little strategic value, has missed its monthly tribute to Coruscant.  Vader has decided to drop in and question the Zalorian minister. \n\nMeet with the Minister Transe Decar and investigate the situation on Zaloriis."

47807, "1. Conserve your troops. It will be a while before you are able to train new ones. \n\n2. Nothing and no one is invincible. Even your best weapons have a weak point.  Use a varied array of units to protect them."

47808, "Darth Vader: Minister Transe Decar, this is Darth Vader."

47809, "Zalor Minister: I'm here, Darth."

47810, "Zalor Militiaman: Freeze!"

47811, "Zalor Militiaman: Drop your weapons!"

47812, "Darth Vader: What is this?"

47813, "Zalor Minister: Zaloriis formally declares its independence."

47814, "Darth Vader: Request denied, Minister."

47816, "Zalor Minister: <chokes>"

47817, "Darth Vader: Where are my soldiers?"

47818, "Zalor Militiaman: I don't know, Lord Vader."

47819, "Darth Vader: I won't repeat myself, Soldier."

47820, "Zalor Militiaman: They're being detained. . .here."

47821, "Darth Vader: Destroy the Rebel scum!"

47822, "Darth Vader: Lieutenant, rally your troops and come with me."

47823, "Stormtrooper: Thank you, Lord Vader."

47824, "Stormtrooper: I'm sorry they got the drop on us."

47825, "Stormtrooper: I accept full responsibility for our lax --."

47826, "Stormtrooper: <choking>"

47827, "Darth Vader: Do not let it happen again, Commander."

47828, "Stormtrooper: Lord Vader, Colonel Veers is being taken back to Zaloriis City."

47829, "Stormtrooper: We can cut them off here if we hurry."

47830, "Darth Vader: Veers has been captured by the Rebels."

47831, "Darth Vader: Commander, your failure will cost us dearly."

47832, "Darth Vader: Colonel, you are too important to the Empire to languish in a prison camp."

47833, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: Lord Vader, we must get back to Fondor II."

47834, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: I've been working on a secret weapon to crush the Rebels, my lord."

47835, "Darth Vader: True."

47836, "Stormtrooper: We have sighting of the convoy, sir."

47837, "Darth Vader: We can use this base to launch a counterattack."

47838, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: My prototype! Its not here."

47839, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: My men must have taken it to the secret base when the fighting began."

47840, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: Come, I'll show you the way."

47841, "Stormtrooper: Colonel Veers!"

47842, "Stormtrooper: We thought you'd been executed."

47843, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: Here it is, the All Terrain, Armored Transport."

47844, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: We've nicknamed it the walker."

47845, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: It's only a prototype, but it has proven to be quite lethal."

47846, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: If we can get this prototype back to Fondor II, my men can finish installing the remaining weapons."

47847, "Stormtrooper: The Dark Lord of the Sith has perished."

47848, "Stormtrooper: The glory of the Empire is lost."

47849, "Darth Vader: Commander, your foolishness has lead to the death of Colonel Veers."

47850, "Darth Vader: Without him, we shall not succeed."

47859, "Darth Vader: Congratulations. . .General Veers."

47860, "General Maximilian Veers: Thank you, my lord."

47861, "Darth Vader: Gather your troops, we're going to the Elrood system."

47862, "General Maximilian Veers: At once, my lord."

47863, "The Prototype AT-AT must not be destroyed."

47864, "Escort the prototype back to Fondor II so it can be outfitted with weapons."

47865, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: Lord Vader, the AT-AT is now fully functional."

47866, "Quash the nascent Rebel uprising on Zaloriis."

47867, "Darth Vader must survive."
