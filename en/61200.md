61207, "Qui-Gon Jinn: A Monument is a gigantic marvel that expresses the hopes and dreams of a people."
61208, "Qui-Gon Jinn: It could hardly be said to have a practical use, but it undoubtedly has a spiritual one."
61209, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Interesting.  We have finished studying the Holocron that Shoran found."

61295, "Han Solo: Which arm?"
61296, "Han Solo: Come on, Chewie, let's go."
61297, "Han Solo: Okay, that's one Jammer. Now let's take care of the rest."
