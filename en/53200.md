53204, "We have found the source of Trade Federation activity on Alaris Prime!  Build a strong army and destroy the Trade Federation Fortress to the North. \n\nMake sure that all your heroes survive the battle."
53205, "1. Every problem has multiple solutions.  It is very likely that there is more than one approach to the Trade Federation's Fortress.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAdvanced Tips:\n\nYou can garrison units inside Turrets and Fortresses, as well as Command Centers.\n\nJedi can convert some enemy units to be allies.  Click on the Jedi, press the C key, and right click on an enemy to convert it to your side.\n\nIf your buildings are damaged, you can use a worker to repair them.  Workers can repair most mechanical units too.\n\nYou can Save your progress at any time.  Press F10 to access the Save and Load menus."
53206, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  I have asked the Jedi Council to allow me to fight with you.  They have agreed, on the condition that you create a Fortress.."
53207, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  We must advance to a new technological level to create a government center.  Then we can destroy the Trade Federation’s Fortress and chase them off Alaris Prime for good."
53208, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Shoran has helped us wall off our camp, but we must complete the job."
53209, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Use your workers to build a medium wall in the gaps."
53210, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You can even click and drag on the ground to build several wall sections in row."
53211, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Be careful not to wall yourself in though.  You should build a gate in one of the larger gaps."
53212, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  A gate allows your units to come and go but keeps enemy forces out."
53213, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  The Trade Federation will be testing your defenses on a regular basis. It is best to stay prepared."
53214, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Have you tried building turrets?  They’re tough, and they fire automatically at enemies."
53215, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Did you know that you can garrison a few troopers inside a turret?  "
53216, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Your troopers will be protected, and they’ll give your turret extra firepower."
53217, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Have you built a war center yet?  It's well worth the cost."
53218, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  A war center gives you numerous upgrades to make you troops tougher and more effective in the field."
53219, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You should be building toward your next Tech Level."
53220, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Click your Command Center to find out what you need to advance."
53221, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You have what you need to advance to the next Tech Level."
53222, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You should do that now."
53223, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You should experiment with the advanced buttons for your units."
53224, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Click on a single trooper to see the advanced buttons."
53225, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  For example, the aggressive stance lets a unit chase enemies across the map. "
53226, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  That’s the default stance for new units."
53227, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  The defensive stance lets a unit defend itself without being drawn too far into trouble."
53228, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  If your forces are spread thin, you can use the advanced buttons to put a trooper on patrol."
53229, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Incoming droid starfighters!  Steel yourself for an attack!"
53230, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  They appear to be scouting.  They will certainly return for an attack shortly."
53231, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  If you select several units at once, you’ll can use formation buttons."
53232, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  For example, a box formation makes your stronger units surround and protect your weaker ones."
53233, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You’ve made it to Tech Level 3"
53234, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  At this stage, your options for both offense and defense become numerous."
53235, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You can now build missile turrets to fend off air attacks.  It would be wise do that right away."
53236, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You should build more missile turrets to defend different areas of the camp."
53237, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You can also build your own Airbase.  Then you can fight the droid starfighters on equal terms."
53238, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Attichitcuk is fully healed and ready to join the fight!"
53239, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  I should very much like to join Chewbacca and Attichitcuk on the battlefield."
53240, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  But I cannot until you build a Fortress."
53241, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  A heavy weapons factory lets you create artillery and other units to do damage at a distance."
53242, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You’ll find there are many benefits to building a Fortress.  You should build one now."
53243, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Good, you have a Fortress.  I shall arrive shortly."
53244, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  I am here."
53245, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  A Fortress allows you to garrison almost any unit"
53246, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  It also rains heavy blaster fire on nearby enemies."
53247, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  It increases your population capacity too."
53248, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  I spotted some strange starships on the way in. I believe the Trade Federation has sent slavers to capture the Wookiee population."
53249, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Your Fortress can create fierce and fearless Wookiee Berserkers."
53250, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Your Airbase can make fighters and bombers, as well as air transport ships to move your units across the map quickly."
53251, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Be careful. If an air transport is shot down, the units inside will perish."
53252, "Destroy the Trade Federation's Fortress to the North."
53253, "All heroes, Chewbacca, Shoran, Attichitcuk and Qui-Gon, must survive."
53254, "Shoran must survive."
53255, "Attichitcuk must survive."
53256, "Qui-Gon Jinn must survive."
53257, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You can advance to Tech Level 4 if you wish.  It’s not necessary to win here, but it couldn’t hurt."
53258, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You’re at the 4th and final Tech Level"
53259, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Now you can build shield generators to defend your buildings."
53260, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Now that you’ve built a shield, watch any buildings and units within its radius.  They’ll slowly acquire shielding."
53261, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You should place your first one near your Command Center."
53262, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Enemy units must wear down shielding before they can damage units or buildings underneath."
53263, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  The most powerful long range unit you can build is the blaster cannon at your Fortress."
53264, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  The blaster cannon must be undeployed for travel and deployed to attack."
53265, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  It takes several seconds to deploy, and is most vulnerable during that time."
53266, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  There’s the Trade Federation Fortress!  To win this battle, we have to reduce it to scrap!"
53267, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You’ve done it.  The Fortress is destroyed!"
53268, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  The Trade Federation has lost its footing on Alaris Prime!"
53269, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Wait!  There are those strange ships again."
53270, "Pekt:  This is but a minor sssssetback."
53271, "Pekt:  We will ssssssee you again."
53272, "Pekt:  The price of Wookiee pelts isn't getting any lower."
