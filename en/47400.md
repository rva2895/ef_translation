47407, "In their haste to remove personnel and military equipment from Yavin, the Rebels were forced to abandon most of their food supplies.  The relatively unprotected planet Reytha was a shrewd choice for their next attack. \n\nThe rich soil of Reytha provides the food for nearly one-tenth of our military forces.  Disruption of the Emperor's storehouses can only hurt the Empire and will certainly aid the Rebellion. \n\nDetermine the extent of the infestation, and repel any Rebel bandits you encounter."

47408, "1. If you find any food production facilities under Rebel control, recapture them to prevent the loss of any more food. \n\n2. The main Rebel force is sizable. Avoid them until you have established a comparable army. \n\n3. Lord Vader’s awesome wrath will draw him into the fray at a moment’s notice.  Make sure he does not fight unattended!"

47409, "Reytha Governor: Lord Vader, this is Governor Belladar."

47410, "Reytha Governor: We are under attack by Rebel extremists intent on disrupting our operation."

47411, "Reytha Governor: They're after one of our large Imperial Food Production Facilities."

47412, "Reytha Governor: Lord Vader, thank you for responding so quickly to my call."

47413, "Darth Vader: Why have you summoned me, Governor?"

47414, "Reytha Governor: As you know, we have been keeping an eye on the Rebels."

47415, "Reytha Governor: Activity has increased and I think they are preparing to mount an assault."

47416, "Darth Vader: Leave them to me."

47417, "Darth Vader must survive"

47418, "Stormtrooper: We've lost Lord Vader!"

47419, "Stormtrooper: I would hate to be the poor fool who has to explain this to the Emperor."

47420, "Darth Vader: Lieutenant, send your troopers to these coordinates, outside the city of Yeere."

47421, "Darth Vader: There you will find an inactive Imperial Command Center."

47422, "Darth Vader: Use it to mount a defense and supply your forces."

47423, "Darth Vader: Lieutenant, send your troopers to these coordinates, outside the city of Yeere."

47424, "Darth Vader: There you will find an inactive Imperial Command Center."

47426, "Reytha Soldier: . . .to anyone that can hear me, we are under attack."

47427, "Reytha Soldier: We are being sieged by the Rebels."

47428, "Reytha Soldier: Send assistance!"

47429, "Reytha Governor: Lord Vader, may I ask for just one more favor?"

47430, "Reytha Governor: It appears that Breeda, a production and storehouse in the west, has already been overrun by the Rebels."

47431, "Reytha Governor: Is there anything you can do to help us?"

47432, "Reytha Governor: Excuse me, my lord."

47433, "Reytha Governor: Lord Vader, may I ask for just one more favor?"

47434, "Reytha Governor: It appears that Breeda, a production and storehouse in the west, has already been overrun by the Rebels."

47435, "Reytha Governor: Is there anything you can do to help us?"

47436, "Reytha Governor: I don't know how you did it Lord Vader, but the Rebels have been repelled from our main complexes."

47437, "Investigate Rebel activity to the north."

47438, "Repel the Rebels on Reytha by wiping out their military units and their Command Center."

47439, "Reytha Soldier: Sir, we're receiving reports of Rebel activity in the islands of Montrosa."

47440, "Reytha Governor: Are you certain, soldier?"

47441, "Reytha Soldier: Yes, Governor."

47442, "Reytha Governor: Lord Vader, I just received some terrible news."

47443, "Darth Vader: Governor Belladar, my patience is wearing thin. . ."

47444, "Darth Vader: We must halt their raids on our supplies."

47445, "Stormtrooper: Lord Vader, initial probot scans show the Rebels have taken over Reytha."

47446, "Darth Vader: Very well, let us wipe this scum from our planet."

47447, "Darth Vader: They are better defended than I foresaw."

47448, "Darth Vader: You have failed me commander."

47449, "Repel the attack from Page's Commandos on Teks."

47450, "Reestablish contact with the outlying food production facilities."

47451, "Repel the Rebel bandits from Breeda."
