49790, "The Hanoon occupation forces are alerted to our presence after our liberation of the town centers on the other side of the asteroid.  They will probably remain close to their base, measuring our strength. \n\nThe Imperials would rather destroy this colony than lose it.  Expect them to attack the Terraform Processor if you gain control. \n\nReconnaissance has spotted four turrets between the transport’s current location and the Main Terraform Processor.  Any of these turrets could sink the transport in a moment. \n\nLarge animals are not indigenous to this asteroid.  It will not be possible to create mounted units."
