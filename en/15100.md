15153, "I’ve watched the struggle for freedom a long time now, mainly from the seat of my X-wing.  "
15154, "It’s an interesting perspective - the Rebellion’s a strange union of pirates, Jedi, royal princesses and then there’s the rest of us."
15155, "Me?  I’m just plain old Wedge Antilles, doing my job."
15156, "One of the stranger tales of the Rebellion has to do with an encounter on Krant, a wilderness planet near the Outer Rim.  "
15157, "Princess Leia traveled there to meet a Bothan spy, when she was shot down by the Imperials."
15158, "The towns of Peche and Theenes pledged their support to the Alliance and agreed to help us in any way they could.  Princess Leia thanked them and turned her attention once more to finding the elusive Ghost Base and our Bothan contact.  "

15162, "Pilot Journal, Entry Thirty-Three and Two"
15163, "The lush forests of Krant are beautiful from the cockpit of an X-wing.  "
15164, "They stretch on for miles.  "
15165, "But it’s quite a different thing to be tramping through them on foot.  "
15166, "That’s why I’m a pilot, lads."
15167, "The forest provided cover for the Rebel teams, but it also hid Ghost Base from those who wished to find it."
15168, "Leia was understandably wary about what else Krant might hide."
15169, "The loss of the Jedi artifact to the Imperials was a crushing blow."
15170, "Despite our victory on Krant, the future looked grim.  The Jedi and the Princess resolved to continue the pursuit to the asteroid called Geddes."
15171, "There, they would attempt to retrieve the artifact."
15172, "Pilot Journal, Entry Thirty-Three and Three"
15173, "Asteroids are cold and lonely places. Not anywhere I’d go willingly."
15174, "Especially not an asteroid stocked with Imperial troops."
15175, "Nevertheless, Leia’s strike force set out for the stronghold in their transports, aiming to recapture the Vor’Na’Tu artifact at any cost."
15176, "Rumors of Darth Vader spread among the crews, that Vader had been dispatched by the Emperor to retrieve the valuable item."
15177, "I never put much stock in rumors, but you can never dismiss them completely."
15178, "When I was a child, I was told the Jedi were a myth -- just a story."
15179, "Echuu Shen-Jon was no myth, these valiant Jedi seemed destined to sacrifice their lives in pursuit of their ideals."
15180, "But his death was not in vain."
15181, "The Vor’Na’Tu was now shattered and useless to the Emperor, or so we all thought."
15182, "Pilot Journal, Entry Thirty-Three and Four"
15183, "Years passed, and the Rebel Alliance forged ahead with its mission."
15184, "And then a very strange thing happened."
15185, "I must say I never understood the notion of the Force, and I never understood Luke’s connection to it, but I’ve seen enough to believe in it."
15186, "I can’t explain it, but somehow Princess Leia was contacted by Echuu Shen-Jon!"
15187, "He told her that the power of the Vor’Na’Tu still existed in the scattered shards on Geddes, now an Imperial-controlled colony named Hanoon."
15188, "Should the Empire discover the shards, the power could still be tapped somehow."
15189, "She left for Hanoon immediately, along with Luke, to retrieve the lost shards."
15190, "We once again captured the Vor’Na’Tu shards."
15191, "But Luke and Leia felt their mission was not yet complete."
15192, "The people of Hanoon deserved freedom."
15193, "Pilot Journal, Entry Thirty-Three and Five"
15194, "The Hanoon needed to control their own world, and in order to do that, they needed to control the Terraform Processor."
15195, "Unfortunately, the machine was located in a heavily-guarded Imperial base.  "
15196, "It was a suicide mission, a mission doomed to failure.  Just the kind of mission Luke loves to take on."
15197, "With the thanks of the Hanoon people, and the shards of Vor’Na’Tu dispersed to the solar wind, they could at last return to base, mission accomplished."
15198, "But until the Empire is defeated, the Rebellion can never truly rest."
15199, "Luke and Princess Leia will always be needed somewhere, to respond to the call for help on a distant planet, or wage a war against the Empire for their very survival."
