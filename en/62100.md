62100, "It will all be over soon."

62101, "We're doomed..."

62102, "I don't like you either."

62103, "What's going on over there?!"

62104, "Utinni!"

62105, "Yub yub!"

62106, "Stay on target!"

62107, "Roger, roger."

62108, "Disen berry, berry bad..."

62109, "You fool!"

62110, "This is madness!"

62111, "Target, maximum firepower!"

62112, "Hello there!"

62113, "And here I thought we were friends..."

62114, "This party's over."

62115, "Er, I think we have a problem..."

62116, "I'm going to regret this..."

62117, "Your situation is hopeless!"

62118, "Crush them!"

62119, "Ooh! Muy muy!"

62120, "Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind."

62121, "I'm going to end this, once and for all!"

62122, "Just hang on!"

62123, "You underestimate my power!"

62124, "Yeehoo!!!"

62125, "How rude!"

62126, "You didn't really think that'd work, did you?"

62127, "I hate you!"

62128, "Good work."

62129, "You have lost!"

62130, "Well, we won't be seeing him again."

62131, "We did it!"

62132, "You're joking, right?!"

62133, "[Tusken Raider Roar]"

62134, "It's them! Blast them!"

62135, "Obi-wan: \"I have a bad feeling about this.\""

62136, "So be it..."

62137, "Don't touch anything."

62138, "Here's where the fun begins!"

62139, "Who's scruffy looking?"

62140, "Mind tricks don't work on me, only money!"

62141, "No bounties on you. A shame."

62142, "Twice the pride, double the fall."

62143, "Can you beat that?!"

62144, "Your move."

62145, "We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough"

62146, "I have the death sentence on twelve systems!"

62147, "I'm not impressed."

62148, "Don't everybody thank me at once..."

62149, "Our first catch of the day."

62150, "We've been waiting for you."

62151, "Deal!"

62152, "That's just great..."

62153, "Oww!"

62154, "[Chewie Roar]"

62155, "He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy!"

62156, "This is it!"

62157, "You're wasting your time!"

62158, "Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly?"

62159, "Almost there..."

62160, "I can sense that you're angry."

62161, "I'll take them myself."

62162, "Whoa! That got him!"

62163, "This bickering is pointless."

62164, "Don't make me destroy you..."

62165, "We need to mobilize, now!"

62166, "I'm not goin' anywhere!"

62167, "I hope you have a backup plan?"

62168, "Gotcha!"

62169, "Let me see your identification!"

62170, "Last mistake they'll ever make!"

62171, "Retreat!"

62172, "I got him!"

62173, "How pleasant of you to join us."

62174, "Don't fail me again!"

62175, "I don't sense anything."

62176, "Watch for enemy fighters!"

62177, "I'm getting too old for this sort of thing..."

62178, "This is ridiculous..."

62179, "A disturbance in the force, there is..."

62180, "This is going to hurt."

62181, "You were the chosen one!"

62182, "Yeehaw!"

62183, "How can you do this?!"

62184, "Send troops to defend that area."

62185, "I've given up trying to argue with you..."

62186, "I think you overestimate their chances."

62187, "I thought you might say that."

62188, "They won't be back for the sequel."

62189, "Nice of you guys to drop by!"

62190, "I don't know where you get your delusions, laser-brain!"

62191, "Surrender, you should."

62192, "Gah! Where are they all coming from?!"

62193, "Watch it, you've got on on your tail!"

62194, "I know what I'm doing!"

62195, "We've gotta give him more time!"

62196, "Everything's perfectly alright now, we're fine... we're all fine here, now, thank you... How are you?"

62197, "What have I done?!"

62198, "These aren't the droids we're looking for."

62199, "Ugh... I am... finished..."
