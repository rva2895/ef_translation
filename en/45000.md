45004, "The Gungans are not so primitive after all.  Their submerged city of Otoh Gunga conceals a technological facility rivaling any we have previously vanquished. \n\nWe have relocated near Otoh Gunga, among the outlying villages that support the underwater city.  You will be competing directly with the Gungans for resources, so you must act quickly to explore the map and locate caches of Nova and ore. \n\nOnward to victory!"
45005, "1.  The water-dwelling Gungans have a strong Naval force consisting primarily of submarines.  Make sure stealth-detecting Frigates are an integral part of your Naval attack force. \n\n2.  Resources are hard to come by on the shores of Otoh Gunga. Search far and wide to get what you need.  And remember, the Gungans will be racing to get these resources as well! \n\n3. Otoh Gunga is well-defended against air units.  Your air force is better used for scouting, and punishing the outlying village Gungans."
45006, "OOM-9:  Our main objective is to find the city called Otoh Gunga and destroy it completely."
45007, "OOM-9:  But first, we must cut the supply lines used to fuel the Gungan Army."
45008, "OOM-9:  Scouts report a Gungan presence on islands to the south."
45009, "OOM-9:  We've located Otoh Gunga.  Standby to destroy."
45010, "OOM-9:  Scanners indicate the city is mostly deserted.  Nevertheless, we must eliminate all remaining resistance."
45011, "OOM-9:  Excellent work.  The main opposition on this shore has been eliminated."
45012, "OOM-9:  Watch for aggressive local fauna.  The animals in this vicinity have been classed A-1 for vicious behavior."
45013, "OOM-9:  We'll need to maintain a defensive perimeter on these islands.  We can't let these resources fall into enemy hands again."
45014, "[Optional] Destroy the Island Gungans to gain access to their minerals."
45015, "OOM-9:  Good work. We have cut off the Gungans' supply lines. They have no further mineral or crystal resources."
45016, "OOM-9:  Watch for incoming enemy strike force. Enemy strategy analysis indicates imminent revenge attack."
45017, "Destroy the Otoh Gunga High Tower Board Room."
