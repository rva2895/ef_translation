49803, "The Rebellion depends primarily on hit-and-fade strikes, a constantly moving fleet, and a well-hidden base of operations. \n\nOur base on Hoth is no longer hidden, but it is temporarily protected, with shielding to defend against orbital strikes, and with an ion cannon to cover the escape of our transports. \n\nWe must defend the Main Shield Generator and Ion Cannon long enough to load up our transports, flee Hoth, and rejoin the Rebel fleet."

49804, "1. You have only moments before the Empire's ground forces arrive. Use the time to examine the layout of your base and plan your defense. \n\n2. Your airspeeders are very deadly against the Imperial walkers, but you have very few of them.  Keep them in sight and protect them from anti-air units."
