52003, "We need to explore this new world. Follow Qui-Gon's instructions to find the camp of Chewbacca's father, Attichitcuk. \n\n(Click on the Intelligence and Reconnaissance buttons below for more information)."
52004, "1. Listen carefully to Qui-Gon's instructions.\n\n2. If you get sidetracked, check midway down the screen for a reminder of what to do next.\n\n3. Think like a Wookiee:  Be wary, but unafraid.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAdvanced Tips:\n\nKeep checking this section for advanced gameplay tips as you continue the learning campaign."
52005, "25,000 years after the invention of hyperspace travel, the galaxy is still not fully explored.   As planets are discovered, the Old Republic endeavors to prevent territorial disputes, dispensing colonization rights slowly and deliberately. \n\nAlaris Prime was discovered independently by Wookiee explorers, who petitioned the Galactic Senate to allow colonization.   A resource-rich planet, capable of supporting numerous races, Alaris Prime  was was finally awarded to the Wookiees after two decades of deliberation. "
52006, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Before we unload workers and equipment, Chewbacca and his friend Shoran need to scout the area."
52007, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Shoran has moved on ahead, but don’t worry.  He left markers so we could find him in this wilderness."
52008, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Good, I see another marker now."
52009, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Let’s go there.  Click on Chewbacca, then right click near the next marker."
52010, "Click on Chewbacca and right-click near the next marker."
52011, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Ah, do you see it?  There’s the next marker."
52012, "Qui-Gon Jinn: In order to get to it, we’ll have to travel through the black area.  Right click on the next marker. "
52013, "Move Chewbacca through the black area to the next marker. "
52014, "Qui-Gon Jinn: I suspect Shoran is nearby."
52015, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Move towards the next marker"
52016, "Qui-Gon Jinn: First, click on Chewbacca...."
52017, "Click on Chewbacca. "
52018, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Now move ahead to the first marker by RIGHT-clicking near it"
52019, "Move Chewbacca by right-clicking near the marker. "
52020, "Qui-Gon Jinn: The black area represents territory you haven’t seen.  It clears up as Chewbacca moves towards it."
52021, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Shoran says he has found an obstruction in the path.  It could be dangerous - we should stick together."
52022, "Qui-Gon Jinn: To explore as a group, click near the units and drag around them."
52023, "Select both units (Chewbacca and Shoran) by clicking and dragging a box around them. "
52024, "Qui-Gon Jinn: I see the problem now.   Scroll north by moving your mouse to the top of the screen."
52025, "Move your cursor to the top of the screen to scroll northward. "
52026, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Good.  Now RIGHT-click near the marker to the north."
52027, "Right-click to move to the next marker. "
52028, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Click on that tall structure to select it. "
52029, "Click on the tall structure to select it. "
52030, "Qui-Gon Jinn: It looks like a malfunctioning power core."
52031, "Qui-Gon Jinn: This world is supposed to be uncolonized.  If someone else was here, what drove them away?"
52032, "Qui-Gon Jinn: No matter.  It's a hazard, and we should get rid of it!"
52033, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Scroll back downward to your group by moving your mouse to the bottom of the screen."
52034, "Scroll back down to your units (Chewbacca and Shoran)."
52035, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Select your explorers by clicking near them and dragging a box around them."
52036, "Select your group by clicking and dragging a box around them. "
52037, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Now scroll north to the power core again, but this time RIGHT-click on it to attack."
52038, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Your units will advance across the map and attack the power core."
52039, "Scroll north and RIGHT-click on the power core to attack it. "
52040, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Excellent work, my friend."
52041, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Chewbacca’s father, Attichitcuk, awaits us to the north.  I can see one his markers ahead."
52042, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Let us continue."
52043, "Travel Northward to find Attichitcuk."
52044, "Attichitcuk: Roooaaarrr!"
52045, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Looks like he’s already staking a claim"
52046, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Keep following the markers until we find Attichitcuk"
52047, "Attichitcuk: Rrroaar!"
52048, "Qui-Gon Jinn: What’s that?  Attichitcuk smells trouble!"
52049, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Gundarks! They're attacking the camp!"
52050, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Don’t worry, they’re no match for Wookiee warriors!"
52051, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Click a warrior and right click a gundark to attack.  Defeat them before they can tear down the camp!"
52052, "Click on your warriors and right-click on the gundarks to attack. "
52053, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Excellent fighting, my friend."
52054, "Qui-Gon Jinn: The gundarks must have damaged that power core and driven off its owners.  We won’t be so easily scared away."
52055, "OOL-2: I have located the malfunctioning power core.  Destroyed by gundarks, sir."
52056, "Viceroy Nute Gunray:  You will deal with these gundarks, OOL-2.  Find them, skin them and bring the pelts to our Trandoshan friends."
52057, "OOL-2: Yes sir."
52058, "Chewbacca is dead!  We cannot continue!"
52059, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Oh no!  Shoran has been killed!"
52060, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Perhaps Alaris Prime cannot be tamed after all..."
52061, "Attichitcuk has been killed!  Our efforts have been in vain..."
