61700, "Sev'Rance Tann: We could use these mechanized units."
61701, "Sev'Rance Tann: More Clone troopers!  "
61702, "Sev'Rance Tann: Count Dooku!  I have failed you..."
61703, "Count Dooku: General Tann, we have suffered a minor setback on Geonosis and must regroup.  You must establish a temporary base on the Kaer Orbital Platform near Tatooine.  "
61704, "Count Dooku: I need you to build an army formidable enough to carry out my plans."
61705, "Count Dooku: General Tann, it appears the Jedi have discovered our operation.  "
61706, "Count Dooku: Prepare for a Republic attack!"
61707, "Sev'Rance Tann: As you command."
61708, "Sev'Rance Tann: We'd better produce this army and get out of here fast."
61709, "Sev'Rance Tann: It's time to pick up this army and leave."
61710, "Sev'Rance Tann: They can't track us if they have no ship."
61711, "Confederacy Trooper: General, we will need to collect resources in order to build our army."
61712, "Confederacy Trooper: Republic cruisers have been spotted, General!"
61713, "Confederacy Trooper: We need to defend ourselves."
61714, "Confederacy Trooper: General Tann, we have located a Republic Transport Ship"
61715, "Sev'Rance Tann: Excellent, reduce it to rubble."
61716, "Republic Trooper: Alert! Alert! Confederacy troops have destroyed our Transport ship!"
61717, "Count Dooku: There is little time to waste negotiating with this Hutt.  Use any means necessary to extract the information we need."
61718, "Count Dooku: Remember, the Hutts are notoriously resistant to a Jedi's power.  Be cautious in dealing with this creature. "
61719, "Count Dooku: If you are forced to bargain, promise Boorka whatever he wants. We shall honor the agreement as we see fit. "
61720, "Sev'Rance Tann: Of course, my Master."
61721, "Boorka the Hutt: <You put up a good fight, for a Jedi.  I like your style!>"
61722, "Boorka the Hutt: <Maybe you should listen to my offer.  I think you'll like what I have to say.>"
61723, "Sev'Rance Tann: I'm listening."
61724, "Boorka the Hutt: <Recently the Republic opened a spaceport outside of Mos Osnoe.  They want a piece of the Outer Rim trade profits to help pay for their little war, heh heh heh.>"
61725, "Sev'Rance Tann: That's a bold move for them.  I'm sure it displeases your organization immensely."
61726, "Boorka the Hutt: <You take out that spaceport and you'll be doing both of us a favor. After the job is done, I'll tell you what you want to know.>"
61727, "Confederacy Trooper: General Tann, there is a Jawa settlement not far from here.  We can acquire droids there to build our camp."
61728, "Sev'Rance Tann: Take a detachment of troops there and convince the Jawas to lend us their droids."
61729, "Sev'Rance Tann: Excellent.  Put them to work as quickly as possible."
61730, "Boorka the Hutt: <Nice work!  Now with the Republic out of the way, maybe we can do a little business together, heh heh heh.>"
61731, "Count Dooku: If what the Hutt says is true and this Decimator device does exist we must learn all we can about its potential and then capture it for ourselves. "
61732, "Count Dooku: Report back to me personally if you find anything."
61733, "Sev'Rance Tann: The Hutt wouldn't dare incur our wrath, Master. I will locate this weapon and learn its secrets. Sev'Rance, out."
61734, "Sev'Rance Tann: Count Dooku, we've located and captured what we believe to be a Decimator device. However, our analysts are unable to decipher the operational codes. "
61735, "Count Dooku: Excellent work."
61736, "Count Dooku: The Republic should have these codes in their databanks located in a Control Center. Be sure and capture any more of these weapons and then hack into their databanks to access these codes."
61737, "Sev'Rance Tann: Understood, Master."
61738, "Sev'Rance Tann: Stop that shuttle!"
61739, "Sev'Rance Tann: No escape for you!"
61740, "Sev'Rance Tann: Count Dooku, all Decimators on Eredenn are accounted for and in our possession. "
61741, "Sev'Rance Tann: My troops have also located the codes for the weapon, but they are encrypted in the memory banks of a Data Droid. "
61742, "Sev'Rance Tann: We were, however, able to discover where the Decimator's are being manufactured: the Wookiee colony world of Alaris Prime."
61743, "Count Dooku: Time is of the essence,  Sev'Rance.  You must escort the Data Droid to the Decimator facilities and decipher the codes it carries.  "
61744, "Count Dooku: There are Wookiee camps throughout Alaris Prime, you must be cautious.  "
61745, "Sev'Rance Tann: I won't fail you, Count Dooku."
61746, "Confederacy Trooper: General Tann, preliminary scans indicate that we are surrounded by Wookiee outposts!"
61747, "Sev'Rance Tann: They shouldn't be a problem.  Those outposts are a good distance away."
61748, "Sev'Rance Tann: We've been discovered!  Quickly, destroy that camp before they can alert the Republic!"
61749, "Sev'Rance Tann: They've found us!  Leave no survivors!  "
61750, "Sev'Rance Tann: They must not send word of our presence!"
61751, "Sev'Rance Tann: We must stop them before they can get to the transmission tower!"
61752, "Sev'Rance Tann: That path must lead to a Wookiee camp. "
61753, "Sev'Rance Tann: There is probably a Wookiee camp just off that trail."
61754, "Sev'Rance Tann: There are facilities to the west."
61755, "Sev'Rance Tann: To the east is a  transmission tower.  "
61756, "Sev'Rance Tann: Let's see if these codes are valuable after all."
61757, "Confederacy Trooper: General Tann has been killed!  We cannot continue."
61758, "Count Dooku: General Tann, eliminate the Decimator facilities."
61759, "Count Dooku: General Tann, what is taking so long? "
61760, "Confederacy Trooper: We're running out of time."
61761, "Confederacy Trooper: We've been discovered!  Wookiee troops are closing in!"
61762, "Sev'Rance Tann: We have already recovered the information, they cannot get word to the Republic in time to stop us."
61763, "Count Dooku: Welcome to the Sarapin System, Sev'Rance.  You now stand before one of the most heavily guarded planets in the Galaxy."
61764, "Count Dooku: You must first navigate the missile turret array surrounding Asteroid 426."
61765, "Count Dooku: Many Republic fighter squadrons are stationed here to protect the defense grid.  Be mindful of them."
61766, "Count Dooku: There is a supply depot on the near side of Asteroid 426.  You will find a small cache of resources there. "
61767, "Count Dooku: Commandeer this outpost at once!"
61768, "Sev'Rance Tann: The Republic will no doubt have the Power Relay defended by Clone troopers and the like.  We shall proceed carefully."
61769, "Count Dooku: Well done, General Tann.  The Force is strong with you indeed.  Now there shall be nothing to stop our invasion."
61770, "Sev'Rance Tann: We've set down on Sarapin, Master, and are establishing a base from which to strike at the Republic. "
61771, "Count Dooku: Very good, General."
61772, "Count Dooku: The Republic defenses will be on full alert.  "
61773, "Count Dooku: The sudden loss of communications with their primary planetary defense grid will have them wary."
61774, "Count Dooku: This will be a crippling blow to the Republic and critical to the advancement of our cause. "
61775, "Count Dooku: Don't fail me, General Tann."
61776, "Sev'Rance Tann: Mt. Corvast will be ours before the next setting of Sarapin Prime, Count Dooku."
61777, "Sev'Rance Tann: Count Dooku, Mt. Corvast is in ruins and the energy stores are ours! "
61778, "Sev'Rance Tann: I've also dispatched the pathetic Jedi Knight, Jor Drakas."
61779, "Count Dooku: I'm quite impressed,  General. You've proven yourself to be a most valuable asset to our cause."
61780, "Mace Windu: Master Echuu, you are in the best position to sabotage the main battleship core."
61781, "Mace Windu: You and your Padawan must destroy the main core before they attempt to leave the system."
61782, "Stam Reath: Master, I sense danger in that direction.  For now, perhaps we should follow the path that heads south?"
61783, "Echuu Shen-Jon: This is too perilous for us.  We should find another way."
61784, "Mace Windu: Master Echuu, proceed north to Dooku's hangar."
61785, "Stam Reath: Master, isn't that...??? "
61786, "Stam Reath: Count Dooku!"
61787, "Echuu Shen-Jon: Stam!!  NO!"
61788, "Stam Reath: On behalf of the Jedi Council, I order you to drop your weapon!"
61789, "Sev'Rance Tann: A Padawan?  Is this the best the Council can do?  HA!"
61790, "Stam Reath: Master, I tried...I am sorry that I have failed you..."
61791, "Echuu Shen-Jon: Stam, no...it I who have failed you."
61792, "Mace Windu: Bring Sarapin back on-line, Echuu. The energy this planet provides is vital to the Republic."
61793, "Mace Windu: Don't let your thoughts dwell on the past.  You must focus on the task at hand. "
61794, "Mace Windu: Your Padawan needs guidance. Be mindful of her growth."
61795, "Echuu Shen-Jon: Yes, Master Windu."
61796, "Mace Windu: May the Force be with you."
61797, "Naat Reath: Master Shen-Jon, what is that?"
61798, "Echuu Shen-Jon: The remains of a Decimator! That must be how the Confederacy took the planet so quickly."
61799, "Echuu Shen-Jon: Master Windu, energy production on Sarapin has been restored. But Dooku and Tann are nowhere to be found."
