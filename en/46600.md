46604, "As we were fleeing the mayhem at Otoh Gunga, the Trade Federation rounded up our Fambaa herds, to slaughter and skin them for profit! These creatures form the backbone of our army and must be recovered! They are being held at Camp 6, near the occupied stronghold of Harte Secur. \n\nRecover the Fambaas so we can outfit them with shield generators and weaponry. \n\nOnce the Fambaas are safe, we must liberate Harte Secur. This will lure the bulk of the Trade Federation army out of Theed, to the battle at Grassy Plains."
46605, "1. Harte Secur is very well defended.  Do not attempt to attack this stronghold without your Fambaa units. \n\n2. Once you’ve recaptured the Fambaas, check your Fortress and Mech Factory for new Fambaa units."
46606, "Destroy Camp 6, rescue Fambaa animals.\n\nRecapture Harte Secur."
46607, "Boss Nass:  Wesa have the troopers, but now wesa need animales to run the big shields and boomers!"
46608, "Captain Tarpals:  Many beasts were taken to Camp 6, Boss. Wesa should busten them out of there, and bringen themsa to our camp!"
46609, "Recover the Fambaa animals from Camp 6 and bring them to your base to be outfitted for battle."
46610, "Boss Nass: Good work. Now wesa have the animales wesa need for the big nasty battle!"
46611, "Destroy the Command Center at Harte Secur."
46612, "Captain Tarpals:  Boss, wesa spotted a town callen Harte Secur, to the south. Tis filled with many Gungan and Naboo prisoners!"
46613, "Boss Nass:  Hmmm...perhaps wesa should show the mackineeks a piece of the Gungan Grand Army.  Then theysa will be quicker to come out of Theed and meet us inna battle."
46614, "Boss Nass and Captain Tarpals must survive."
