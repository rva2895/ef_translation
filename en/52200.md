52202, "Learn how to gather resources with Qui-Gon's help. \n\nGather 200 food, 100 carbon,  50 ore, and 50 nova crystals. \n\n(Click on the Intelligence and Reconnaissance buttons below for more information)."
52203, "1. Stay near the camp until Chewbacca arrives.  You don't want your workers caught fighting gundarks alone.\n\n2. Don't let workers stand idle.  If they've stopped working, give them something else to do.\n\n3. Look in the lower right corner for the Objectives button.  This will tell you what you’ve accomplished, and what you still need to do.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAdvanced Tips:\n\nClick on the Objectives button to remind yourself of objectives, intelligence and reconnaissance data."
52204, "Resources are necessary for a strong colony.  The more resources a colony gathers, the more workers, buildings and research it can muster.  A typical colony will travel through stages, from living off the land, to an independent economy, to a thriving economy with a strong defense,  and eventually to a nascent empire. "
52205, "Qui-Gon Jinn: The key to colonization is self-sufficiency.  We'll begin gathering resources right away. "
52206, "Qui-Gon Jinn: We will need to gather 200 food, 100 carbon, 50 nova crystals, and 50 ore."
52207, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Food can be found in many places.  The most immediate source is from muja fruit bushes. "
52208, "Qui-Gon Jinn: To begin, click one worker..."
52209, "Select one worker by clicking on it. "
52210, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Now look in the status area at the bottom of the screen. "
52211, "Qui-Gon Jinn: If you have a worker selected, you can see how much food the worker is holding. "
52212, "Qui-Gon Jinn: The worker will keep picking muja fruit until he is carrying 10 food. "
52213, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You can monitor your current stockpiles of food above the mini-map on the lower right corner of the screen."
52214, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You can also monitor your carbon, Nova Crystal, and ore stockpiles."
52215, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You've gathered 50 food, which is enough to create another worker. "
52216, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  See that large building?  That's your Command Center. "
52217, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Click on your Command Center...."
52218, "Click on your Command Center...."
52219, "Qui-Gon Jinn: ....then click the Create Worker button in the lower left corner of the screen. "
52220, "Click on your Command Center, and click the Create Worker button."
52221, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Now watch the progress bar in the status area at the bottom of the screen. "
52222, "Qui-Gon Jinn: When the progress bar reaches 100%, your new worker will appear next to your Command Center!"
52223, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Another way to gather food is by shore fishing."
52224, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Take your new worker and move him towards the river to the East. "
52225, "Move your worker toward the river to the East. "
52226, "Qui-Gon Jinn: See those jumping fish?  Select your worker and right-click on the fish."
52227, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Your worker will start fishing... and adding to your food stockpiles."
52228, "Right-click on the jumping fish to make your worker gather fish. "
52229, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Chewbacca should be along any minute.  Until then, keep your workers gathering resources."
52230, "Qui-Gon Jinn: By now, you should have enough food to create another worker at your Command Center. "
52231, "Click your Command Center and create another worker."
52232, "Qui-Gon Jinn: That should be enough workers to get the job done. "
52233, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  If any workers are idle, the 'Idle Worker' button will flash below the mini-map."
52234, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Click on the button to jump to any workers who aren't pulling their weight. "
52235, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Keep in mind that your workers aren't trained warriors like Chewbacca.  They can be vulnerable to attacks from gundarks and the like. "
52236, "Qui-Gon Jinn: When workers are in trouble, they can run to the Command Center for shelter. "
52237, "Qui-Gon Jinn: They can even shoot at invaders from the Command Center. "
52238, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Let's try a drill.  Click on the Command Center. "
52239, "Click your Command Center...."
52240, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Now click on the Activate Alert Beacon button. Your workers will take shelter in the Command Center. "
52241, "Click on the Command Center and click the Activate Alert Beacon button."
52242, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Excellent!"
52243, "Qui-Gon Jinn: With the Command Center selected, activate the Alert Beacon button again to resume gathering resources. "
52244, "At your Command Center, click the Activate Alert Beacon button  to send workers back to work."
52245, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You've got enough food.  It's time to gather carbon. "
52246, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Carbon is used to create duraplast, which we use for building. "
52247, "Qui-Gon Jinn: On Alaris Prime, the best place to find carbon is from trees."
52248, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Click on a worker, then click on a tree. The worker will attach an extractor ring to the tree and gather carbon from it.. "
52249, "Gather carbon by clicking your workers and right-clicking on a tree."
52250, "Chewie:  Rooaaaarrrr"
52251, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Ah, here comes Chewbacca.  "
52252, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Now, to begin gathering food from the muja fruit bush, right-click on it."
52253, "Right-click on a muja fruit bush to gather from it. "
52254, "Qui-Gon Jinn: To gather food faster, select all your workers and send them to work by right-clicking on a fruit bush. "
52255, "Make all your workers gather food. "
52256, "Qui-Gon Jinn: While your workers work, you should send Chewbacca exploring."
52257, "Qui-Gon Jinn: It's always a good idea to venture beyond the homestead to map out the territory and search for more resources. "
52258, "Qui-Gon Jinn: That's plenty of carbon.  You should start looking for formations of nova or ore. "
52259, "Find and gather green Nova Crystals and some purple Ore. "
52260, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Excellent, you found some Nova Crystals.  These are a valuable commodity that is used as currency throughout the galaxy."
52261, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You'll need to 50 Nova Crystals to go any further."
52262, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You've found ore.  When processed, ore becomes durasteel, which is used to make buildings and defenses strong. "
52263, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You'll need 50 ore to continue. "
52264, "Gather 200 food, 100 carbon, 50 Nova crystals, and 50 ore. \n\nFend off any more gundark attacks."
52265, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You've collected resources like an expert frontiersman!"
52266, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Are you sure you haven't colonized a planet before? "
52267, "Qui-Gon Jinn: I sense trouble.... gundarks are approaching!"
52268, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Select your Command Center and activate the Alert Beacon to bring the workers inside!"
52269, "At your Command Center, press the Activate Alert Beacon button!"
52270, "Qui-Gon Jinn: That was quick thinking.  You can put your workers back to work now. "
52271, "Activate the Alert Beacon at your Command Center  to resume gathering resources."
52272, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Chewbacca is dead!  We must abort the mission!"
52273, "Your Command Center has been destroyed!"
52274, "Qui-Gon Jinn: It is impossible to continue!"
52275, "Your workers have all died!"
52276, "Qui-Gon Jinn: It is impossible to continue!"
52277, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Then he will carry it to the Command Center and return to the muja fruit bush for more. "
52278, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You can learn more by moving your mouse over any of the symbols on the bottom of the screen. "
52279, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You can also see a miniature map of your surrounding area."
52280, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Excellent, you found some nova crystals.  These are a valuable commodity that is used as currency throughout the galaxy."
52281, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You'll need to 50 Nova Crystals to go any further."
52282, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You've found all the Nova Crystals you'll need."
52283, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You've gathered enough ore for now."
