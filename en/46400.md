Queen Amidala and Boss Nass are determined to overthrow the invaders, but they are in need of an army. \n\nMany Gungans escaped the demolition of Otoh Gunga; they require only a place to gather and a symbol to rally around. While the Queen’s people prepare to infiltrate Theed, we must destroy the Neimoidian Throne in Spinnaker and build our own monument, to call the Gungans back and reestablish the Grand Gungan Army."
