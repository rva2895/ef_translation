44603, "We have occupied the countryside surrounding Theed and the city awaits our armies.  But a signal jammer prevents our droid starfighters and transports from approaching. \n\nYou will enter Theed with a battalion of elite units and destroy the signal jammer.  Then you will build a Monument so the Viceroy can land. \n\nQueen Amidala has advised her military to stand down, but we expect scattered resistance throughout the city."

44604, "1. The straightest and easiest route to the palace is through the main boulevard which heads north through the center of the city.\n\n2. Resistance should be light, as long as you keep civilian casualties to a minimum. \n\n3. Destroy any military buildings you find to prevent the citizenry from rising up before our occupation is complete."

44605, "You have capture the capital city of Theed!!"

44606, "You have failed, on to the scrap pile."

44607, "OOM-9:  We are now in position to take the Capital City of Theed.  First we need you to take out their systems jammer near the main Royal Hangar so that we can launch a full scale invasion of the city.  Once the jammer is down we will send you reinforcements."

44608, "Naboo Security: The Trade Federation army has entered the city!"

44613, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: The Royal Palace was destroyed."

44614, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: The Naboo will certainly be far more resistant to our take over!"

44615, "Take out the jamming device so reinforcements can arrive."

44616, "OOM-9: The Jammer is destroyed."

44617, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: Our final destination is Amidala's palace."

44618, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: Merely get at least five troops within the palace grounds."

44628, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: Here are the resources you will need to build my throne."

44629, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: Do not waste your time and resources on building anything but my Throne."

44630, "Naboo Security: The Trade Federation army is crossing the east bridge!"

44631, "OOM-9: We've lost too many units to capture the palace!"

44632, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: OOM-9, the time has come to take the city of Theed."

44633, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: Target only offensive units."

44634, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: OOM-9, your first objective is to take out the system jamming device so that we can land reinforcements within the city."

44635, "Do not build anything but the Neimoidian Throne."

44636, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: You no longer have the time or resources to build my throne."

44637, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: You have failed me, OOM-9."
