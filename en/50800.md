50802, "Okikuti"
50803, "Wookiees began emerging from the forest almost before the Government Tree was finished.  It was from them that we learned the rest of the story. \n\nWhen the Imperial governor of Kashyyyk, Moff Darcc, heard of the Emperor’s death at Endor, he knew the Empire was finished, and that it was time to look after his own interests.  He had an entire planet, and a lot of Imperial hardware, and he decided to keep both. \n\nWhat he didn’t need was a bunch of Wookiee natives, so he called a Trandoshan slaver named Pekt.  Pekt agreed to clear Kashyyyk of Wookiees, provided he could sell them for slaves… and for pelts. \n\nIt was time to contact the Rebellion. Weebacca told Han and Chewie that the Empire's signal jammer installation was at the town of Okikuti. \n\nTake your forces to Okikuti and destroy those jammers!"
50804, "1. The Empire is on to your plans, and we don’t have the power to take them on yet.  Don’t even attempt to fight back - just defend the gates until you find a way to escape. \n\n2. Examine the confines of your base carefully. You may find a backdoor to escape through."
50805, "Han Solo:  Hmm, it's too quiet here."
50806, "Han Solo:  I don't see any Imperial Jammers, Chewie."
50807, "Chewbacca:  grrrr grruh..."
50808, "Han Solo:  I knew it!"
50809, "Han Solo: It's a trap!"
50810, "Han Solo: Weebacca betrayed us!"
50811, "Chewbacca: Roar!!"
50812, "Han Solo:  We need to hold them off long enough to find an escape route!"
50813, "Take Han and Chewie to Okikuti."
50814, "Defend Okikuti from the Galactic Empire long enough to find an escape route."
50815, "Han Solo: I just gotta ask.  Are we going the right way to Okikuti?"
50816, "Chewbacca:  Roar!"
50817, "Han Solo: I have a bad feeling about this."
50818, "Chewbacca:  Rrrraaa!"
50819, "Han Solo: We need to find a way out of here."
50820, "Han Solo:  We can cut through these trees and escape by water!"
