48806, "This was supposed to be a simple mission; Leia would fly to Krant in a diplomatic shuttle with an honor guard, meet with the Bothan, and return to Alderaan. \n\nNow, after a short hyperspace trip and quick tussle with an Imperial TIE Fighter, we’re stranded on an Imperial controlled world. \n\nSearch the planet of Krant for Ghost Base, and the Bothan named Utric Sandov."
