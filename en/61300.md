61300, "Han Solo: What do you mean, you want to attack the Moff's Palace?"

61301, "Han Solo: That's suicide."

61302, "Han Solo: I don't care if it's not suicide for a Wookiee."

61303, "Han Solo: Shoran, can you talk some sense into him?"

61304, "Han Solo: We're not attacking the palace!"

61305, "Han Solo: Brilliant!"

61306, "Han Solo: Don't get cocky!"

61307, "Han Solo: Great."

61308, "Han Solo: What do you know, he likes the idea. . ."

61309, "Han Solo: We'll need to defend Kepitenochan as well."

61310, "Han Solo: Don't want them sneaking up on us from behind."

61311, "Han Solo: Hey, the more the merrier."

61312, "Han Solo: Great, I see."

61313, "Han Solo: We can use these guys to go attack the Jammers at Chenachochan."

61314, "Han Solo: Maybe we should see about finding those berserkers..."

61315, "Han Solo: There's got to be a better way to penetrate their fortifications."

61316, "Han Solo: Get us out of here alive, Chewie!"

61317, "Han Solo: That palace must have a weakness of some kind.  "

61318, "Han Solo: It's up to us to find it."

61319, "Han Solo: It just gets better and better, eh, ol' buddy?"

61320, "Han Solo: We're through the shield walls!"

61321, "Han Solo: Let's go!"

61322, "Han Solo: Hey, isn't that?"

61323, "Han Solo: Get him!"

61324, "Han Solo: I never liked you."

61325, "Han Solo: Watch out, Chewie!"

61326, "Han Solo: Be careful!"

61327, "Han Solo: That's one way to deal with Weebacca."

61328, "Han Solo: It sounded like it came from beyond that tree line..."

61329, "Han Solo: No sign of Darcc.  I'll wager that's him and Pekt in that transport."

61330, "Han Solo: I know, I know we'd better get up to that platform before those slavers leave the system."

61331, "Han Solo: Yeah, buddy, I heard it, too.  Sounds like it came from just behind that tree line."

61332, "Han Solo: You'll find I'm just full of surprises."

61333, "Han Solo: Lead the way to Ittummi."

61334, "Han Solo: I'll bet you banthas to bucketheads that's Darcc and Pekt in that transport."

61335, "Han Solo: Don't tell me, let me guess - we're going to the Avatar Orbital Platform to free the slaves before they're transported off-world."

61336, "Han Solo: I told you not to tell me."

61337, "Han Solo: Hey, I hear ya."

61338, "Luke Skywalker: A friend of yours said you might be needing some help."

61339, "Han Solo: Wipe out any military buildings you find."

61340, "Han Solo: There are Wookiees in that detention center."

61341, "Han Solo: Now let's go get the bad guys."

61342, "Han Solo: Uh-oh."

61343, "Pekt: (Death moan)"

61344, "Pekt: You are going to be my ticket out of here."

61345, "Han Solo: Friend?"

61346, "Han Solo: Hey, you be careful flying that thing!"

61347, "Han Solo: We'll talk about that later."

61348, "Han Solo: Right now, we've got a few other pressing matters."

61349, "Han Solo: Like taking out those enemy structures."

61350, "Han Solo: Yes, nice to meet you."

61351, "Han Solo: I owe you one."

61352, "Han Solo: I think Darcc is down in the control center."

61353, "Han Solo: If we blow the power core, this whole place will go up!"

61354, "Han Solo: We gotta get those guys out of there."

61355, "Han Solo: We gotta wipe out any military buildings we find, or we've had it."

61356, "Han Solo: Pekt is holed up in the Government Center."

61357, "Han Solo: Pekt is holed up in the Control Center."

61358, "Han Solo: Hey, while we're at it, why don't we storm Imperial High Command?"

61359, "Lando Calrissian: You got a better idea?"

61360, "Han Solo: Off the top of my head. . .no."

61361, "Lando Calrissian: We've got portable air tanks, so we'll be fine."

61362, "Han Solo: Unfortunately, so do the Imperials."

61363, "Luke Skywalker: That's two factories back on-line! "

61364, "Luke Skywalker: It's better than no air at all!  Now let's finish up these Imperials so we can go home!"

61365, "Lando Calrissian: That's it."

61366, "Luke Skywalker: We've paved the way for Kessel to be a free world."

61367, "Han Solo: Great."

61368, "Han Solo: I can start shaking the sand out of my boots."

61369, "Luke Skywalker: The prisoners are starting to die! We've got to get all four factories working again!"

61370, "Han Solo: Luke, help me out on this."

61371, "Han Solo: Great."

61372, "Han Solo: Let me make sure my blaster's loaded."

61373, "Han Solo: We've done it, we've liberated a mining camp."

61374, "Han Solo: Great, now can we go get dinner?"

61375, "Han Solo: I'm starved."

61376, "Luke Skywalker: I think we need to take back the three main mining cities if we're going to get control of this world."

61377, "Luke Skywalker: I think we need to take back the main mining cities if we're going to get control of this world."

61378, "Luke Skywalker: The workers are joining us."

61379, "Luke Skywalker: These Wookiee miners have offered to help us establish a base."

61380, "Luke Skywalker: Alright, lets finish these Imperial goons!"

61381, "Lando Calrissian: We're going to need to take back the three main mining cities if we're going to get control of this world."

61382, "Lando Calrissian: We're going to need to take back the main mining cities if we're going to get control of this world."

61383, "Lando Calrissian: Great, that's one mining camp down."
