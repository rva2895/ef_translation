15001, "A long time have I watched the man called Darth Vader from the darkness, from the shadows of my Master’s chambers.  "
15002, "The last of the Jedi Knights, the last of two Sith Lords, a solitary man with an unquenched thirst for revenge."
15003, "He now pursues the last stragglers of the Alliance to the fourth moon of Yavin, where he will unleash his anger and avenge the destruction of the Death Star."
15004, "I believe the Rebels scarcely know the swift and sudden retribution that awaits them."

15007, "The cowardly demolition of Yavin Base cost us many good troopers, but the capture of General Dodonna far outweighs the loss.   "
15008, "Our revenge is complete."
15009, "I am continuing my observation."
15010, "Transmission X213-99  Location: Reytha  Encoded to Emperor Palpatine.  Mara Jade transmitting."
15011, "How quickly the 'great' General Dodonna collapsed under the overwhelming might of Lord Vader’s rage.  "
15012, "He should have realized there is nothing a single man can do to forestall the march of the Empire."
15013, "In his final moments, the fool even let slip that the Rebels intended to capture our food production centers on Reytha."

15018, "No doubt, the infection has spread far into the planet."
15019, "Transmission X342-11  Location: Reytha  Encoded to Emperor Palpatine.  Mara Jade transmitting."
15020, "The weakness of Governor Belladar leads Lord Vader to suspect the Rebel infiltration extends further into Reytha."
15021, "His dark intuition serves him well, for Imperial scouts have determined the location of a large Rebel force among the islands of Montrosa, a force which requires immediate extermination."
15022, "They will not escape this time."
15023, "End transmission."
15024, "Transmission X342-11E  Location: Reytha  Encoded to Emperor Palpatine.  Mara Jade transmitting."
15025, "The total annihilation of the Rebel forces on Reytha will no doubt serve as an example to those who wish to oppose us.  "
15026, "Lord Vader’s vindication of the Empire should be commended."
15027, "Transmission X455-66  Location: Zaloriis  Encoded to Emperor Palpatine.  Mara Jade transmitting."
15028, "The skirmish on Reytha no doubt encouraged a few fools to try and ask the Rebellion to wrest control of their planets from the Emperor.  "
15029, "During my training I have witnessed few who dared defy the Empire.  "
15030, "My Master made certain they were always quickly corrected.  "
15031, "When a planet falls out of line, it too must be corrected."
15032, "Sometimes this requires the unrelenting power of the entire Imperial Army."
15033, "Sometimes it requires more than that.  "
15034, "Sometimes it requires a Sith Lord."
15035, "End transmission."
15036, "Transmission X455-66E  Location: Zaloriis  Encoded to Emperor Palpatine.  Mara Jade transmitting."
15037, "Zaloriis proved to be less than equal to the task of resisting Vader’s will.  "
15038, "The pathetic Rebel base has been demolished, and the Empire has acquired a new and powerful technology.  "
15039, "My Master seems pleased; his apprentice grows ever stronger.  "
15040, "I am the Emperor’s Hand, the silent will of the Emperor himself, but my ambition will take me far above even this exalted rank. "
15041, "But for now, I wait."

15043, "There is a disturbance in the Force."
15044, "Lord Vader pursues the Rebel Alliance to the remote world of Hoth.  "
15045, "But does he truly hunt the Alliance, or is it something else that draws him there, something stronger?"
15046, "My Master has foreseen that Vader has an heir, a son, one who is strong in the Force, one who could destroy us all."
15047, "Does Vader seek to turn him or join him?"
15048, "This coming battle may prove Vader’s intent."
15049, "I secretly hope he will betray us.  "

15053, "A glorious day for the Empire- the Rebel Alliance has suffered its worst defeat yet.  "
15054, "They were utterly unprepared for the assault of General Veers’ walkers, and paid with their lives. "
15055, "Lord Vader emerges victorious again, and my Master is most pleased with him. "
15056, "Any suspicions of Vader’s loyalty lie cold in the ashes of the destroyed Rebel base."
15057, "And I must retreat to the shadows to bide my time and wait."
15058, "But Mara Jade will have her day."

15061, "Acting on the information of a bounty hunter, Lord Vader pursues the Rebellion’s top personnel to the Cloud City of Bespin. "
15062, "Seizing an opportunity to take control of the valuable Tibanna gas reserves, the Dark Lord’s troops mass to invade and control the small outpost. "
15063, "A small band of security personnel and Rebel troops have banded together to defend the city in a pathetic attempt to forestall the inevitable."

15071, "I have just returned from Tatooine; my undercover mission to assassinate Luke Skywalker a failure."
15072, "The Emperor will have little mercy for me."
15073, "But we have a new opportunity to stop the young Jedi.  "
15074, "Our informants reveal the Rebellion will strike next at the construction yards of the new Death Star—a forest moon of Endor, where a small shield generator protects the battle station. "
15075, "A wise tactic, but one that will ultimately fail."
15076, "We must defend the shield generator at all costs.  The future of the Empire depends upon it."
15077, "This historical simulation is provided as a test of your leadership abilities."

15081, "The defenders at the shield generator triumphed over their terrorist attackers."
15082, "Now we will see the last vestige of the Rebellion crushed, and its leaders bow before us."
15083, "Their failed attempt to capture the shield generator has resulted in the capture of General Han Solo and Princess Leia, and the total annihilation of their starfleet."
15084, "I can only wonder now what has become of my Master and young Skywalker."
15085, "There is a disturbance in the Force."
