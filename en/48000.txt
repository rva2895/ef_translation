48008, "The thinnest of leads has brought Lord Vader’s fleet to the Elrood system in search of the Rebels. Vader seems more confident than the evidence would merit, as if drawing knowledge from the very vacuum of space. \n\nProbe droids have been dispatched to every world in this system, and returned imagery of scattered settlements on most of them.  Lord Vader glanced at one such image and instantly changed our course; he is convinced that our prey will be found on the icy wasteland called Hoth."

The Rebels’ powerful shields have forced us to land outside their base.  Take out the Main Power Generator to bring those shields down. \n\n3. The presence of the Ion Cannon is a threat to our Star Destroyers.  Take it out, so the fleeing Rebels will fall right into our grasp."
