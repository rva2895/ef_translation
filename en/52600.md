52602, "Attichitcuk"
52603, "Attichitcuk has gone exploring.  Until he returns, we should remain at camp, gather resources, and research new technologies. \n\n(Click on the Intelligence and Reconnaissance buttons below for more information). "
52604, "1. You will need one new building, a Food Processing Center or an Animal Nursery, and 500 food, before you can research the next tech level.\n\n2. At tech level 2, you can research an upgrade for your warriors at your Troop Center.\n\n3. Chewbacca is your strongest warrior.  Take him along on any dangerous missions.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAdvanced Tips:\n\nAny moving units will strive to reach their destination first before defending themselves.  You may have to tell them to attack if they encounter an enemy en route.\n\nYou can double-click on a unit to select all on-screen units of the same type."
52605, "Congratulations!"
52606, "Our efforts have been in vain!"
52608, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  First we'll research Basic Training.  Click on your Command Center..."
52609, "Click on your Command Center."
52610, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  ...and click the Basic Training button."
52611, "Click the Basic Training button."
52612, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Research costs resources and takes time, but it is worth the effort."
52613, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Your task will be to determine what you can afford to research and when."
52614, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  If you click a worker, you'll see they have a new armor rating in the status area."
52615, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Your workers will stand a better chance when the enemy attacks."
52616, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Put your upgraded workers to the task of gathering food from the muja fruit bushes."
52617, "Gather food from the muja fruit bushes."
52618, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You'll need 500 food and two buildings from your current tech level to advance to a new technology level."
52619, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  While your workers are gathering resources, perhaps you can send your troops out to explore the area near the camp."
52620, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Do not scout too far, though."
52621, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Attichitcuk will be returning soon."
52622, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  I'm going to show you a few more way to speed up the gathering of food."
52623, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  If you build a Food Processing Center close to a source of food, your workers won't have to walk as far to deliver their food."
52624, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Click a worker, then on the build button, and click Build Food Processing Center."
52625, "Click on a worker, then on the Buildings button, then on Build Food Processing Center."
52626, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Another source of food is farms.  Have one of your workers build a farm."
52627, "Build a farm near your Food Processing Center or your Command Center."
52628, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  When the worker finishes his farm, he'll begin harvesting food from it."
52629, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You need only one worker to harvest a farm."
52630, "Continue gathering resources.  You'll need 500 food before you can advance."
52631, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You can create a renewable source of food with an Animal Nursery."
52632, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Click a worker and have them build an Animal Nursery."
52633, "Use a worker to build an Animal Nursery within the radius of your Power Core."
52634, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  If you have any nerfs standing around, you can herd them into your new Animal Nursery."
52635, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Just select a nerf, hold down the ALT key and right-click the nursery."
52636, "Herd some Nerfs into your Animal Nursery.  Click a Nerf, hold down the ALT key and RIGHT-click on the nursery."
52637, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Animals in your nursery add to your food stores over time."
52638, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  The more nerfs you keep inside your nursery, the more food you'll get."
52639, "Continue gathering resources.  You now meet the building requirements for Tech Level 2.  You need only 500 food to be able to advance."
52640, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You've met the requirements to advance to a new tech level!"
52641, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Click on your Command Center, then choose Advance to Tech Level 2."
52642, "Click on your Command Center and click the Research Tech Level 2 button."
52643, "Collect 500 food and build two new buildings, then research Tech Level 2 at your Command Center."
52644, "Attichitcuk:  ROARORROARORAROR!"
52645, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Attichitcuk is back.  He'll work his way back across the map."
52646, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  He says he spotted some Battle Droids lurking in the area."
52647, "Battle Droid:  Halt.  You are ordered to come with us."
52648, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Battle droids!"
52649, "Attichitcuk:  ROARROARORARO--"
52650, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Attichitcuk has been shot down!  But wait-- I sense the spark of life in him still."
52651, "Chewbacca:  ROARORAROARRAORAROR!!"
52652, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Stay calm.  In moments we'll be able to create a medic.  Then we can find Attichitcuk and bring him back."
52653, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Okay.  Click on your Command Center and create a Wookiee Medic."
52654, "Create a medic at your Command Center."
52655, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  In addition, click on your Troop Center and choose Upgrade To Bowcaster Trooper."
52656, "Research Bowcaster Trooper at your Troop Center."
52657, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  This research will make all your existing warriors more skillful."
52658, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Now, assemble your warriors and your medic at the edge of town and go find Attichitcuk."
52659, "Send Chewbacca, your medic and some troopers to rescue Attichitcuk.  "
52660, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You're approaching Trade Federation territory now."
52661, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Stick together and expect an attack at any time."
52662, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  More Battle Droids!  Take them down quickly!"
52663, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  If any of your troopers are badly wounded, you should take a moment to apply first aid."
52664, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Click on your medic, and right click on the wounded unit to heal them."
52665, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  A medic that is near a wounded unit will automatically apply first aid."
52666, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You've found Chewbacca's father..."
52667, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  He is critically wounded.  We must heal him before he can move."
52668, "Heal Attichitcuk with your medic."
52669, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  He can move, but he is still weak.  Beware of Trade Federation entanglements on the return trip."
52670, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  You should garrison Attichitcuk in your Command Center to keep him safe."
52671, "Take Attichitcuk to your Command Center."
52672, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Select Attichitcuk, click the garrison button, then click on your Command Center."
52673, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  I sense another attack coming.  Gather your forces and be ready."
52674, "Ready yourself for a Trade Federation attack."
52675, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Destroyer droids!  They are very dangerous!  You’ll need all your forces to beat them back!"
52676, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Chewbacca is dead!  We must abort the mission!"
52677, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Attichitcuk has been killed!  Our efforts have been in vain!"
52678, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  It would be unwise to proceed before your warriors are stronger."
52679, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  When you see five Battle Droids, you can assume there are 500 on the other side of the hill."
52680, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  We are in no position to challenge the Trade Federation army.  For now, we will concentrate on defending ourselves if they challenge us."
52681, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  Chewbacca's father has taken several warriors and gone scouting."
52682, "Qui-Gon Jinn:  While we await his return, we need to advance to the next technological level and repel any raids that the Trade Federation throws against us."
52683, "Attichitcuk is out scouting. Stay near your camp until he appears."
