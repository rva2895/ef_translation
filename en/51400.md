51404, "Chewbacca’s father, Attichitcuk, could have avoided the trouble on Kashyyyk altogether. When he fought alongside Leia and Echuu years ago, he was a free Wookiee, searching for his son, who had been enslaved by the Empire.  He eventually abandoned the search and returned to Kashyyyk to look after his people. \n\nNow he was once again leaving Kashyyyk, but as a slave himself. Pekt had taken him and several other Wookiees off to a waystation above Kashyyyk called the Avatar orbital platform.  Once a Wookiee was shipped off Avatar, they were likely to be lost forever. \n\nRescue Attichitcuk and the other Wookiees on the Avatar platform. Destroy the Airbases to keep the Imperials from escaping, then bring the fight to Darcc and Pekt."
51405, "1. This Imperial platform is very symmetrical in design.  Use this knowledge when scouting and attacking. \n\n2. Surgical strikes on the missile turrets will make your air support much more effective. \n\n3. Avatar has no resources. Your only source of military units will be what you start with and any Wookiees you rescue. \n\n4. Protect your cannons. Their ability to outrange turrets is invaluable."
51406, "Han and Chewie have destroyed the Fortress in Moff Darcc's palace on Kashyyyk only to realize that Moff Darcc and the Trandoshan Pekt have escape.  Han, Chewie and a small Wookiee contingent have followed them to the Avatar Orbital platform in hopes of stopping them before they can escape.  Hopefully they can also free any Wookiee slaves that may be in preparation for transport on the platform."
51407, "Han Solo: And I thought going after the palace was crazy."
51408, "Han Solo: This place is bristling with guns."
51409, "Luke Skywalker: This is Rogue Squadron."
51410, "Luke Skywalker: You boys need a hand down there?"
51411, "Han Solo: Hey, Luke, is that you?"
51412, "Luke Skywalker: One and the same."
51413, "Han Solo: Chewieee!  No!!!!!"
51414, "Destroy the Airbases before transports allow Imperial forces to escape."
51415, "Destroy the guard towers to free the captured Wookiees in the detention center."
51416, "Han Solo: I love family reunions."
51417, "Attichitcuk: Growl..."
51418, "Han Solo: Thanks, Attichitcuk."
51419, "Han Solo: Yes, nice to see you again."
51420, "Blow up the main reactor to destroy the Avatar orbital platform."
51421, "Han Solo: Whooohoo!"
51422, "Luke Skywalker: I love a happy ending."
51423, "Capture the Trandoshan slaver Pekt holed up in the Fortress."
51424, "Pekt: Freeze, human."
51425, "Han Solo: Man, you Trandoshans are ugly up close."
51426, "Pekt: The feeling is mutual, human."
51427, "Luke Skywalker: Han!  I think he's. . .dead!"
51428, "[Optional] Destroy all of the military structures."
51429, "Han Solo: If we blow the main reactor, this whole place will go up!"
51430, "Han Solo: The only trick is getting out of here before it does."
51431, "Han Solo: We gotta get those Wookiees out of the detention center."
51432, "Han Solo: We gotta get those Wookiees out of the detention center."
51433, "Han Solo: I just got a transmission from Lando."
51434, "Han Solo: Pekt is holed up in the Fortress."
51435, "Han Solo: I just got a transmission from Lando."
51436, "Han Solo: Pekt is holed up in the Fortress."
51437, "Eliminate Moff Darcc and the Trandoshan slaver Pekt, holed up in the Fortress."
51438, "Han Solo: It looks like your ticket has been punched."
51439, "Chewbacca: Grroowl..."
51440, "Attichitcuk must survive."
51441, "Han Solo and Chewbacca must survive."
51442, "Luke Skywalker and Lando Calrissian must survive."
51443, "Han Solo: We gotta take out those Airbases before the Empire can use its transports to escape!"
51444, "Han Solo: The Bucketheads are getting away!"
