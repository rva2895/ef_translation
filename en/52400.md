52404, "1. You'll begin with just enough carbon to get started.  Assign at least one worker to chopping wood.\n\n2. Explore the map, but be mindful of danger unless you have a full complement of troopers.\n\n3.

52405, "Controlling the land  is one thing;  fighting against a predatory enemy is another.   The same tools that allow for a successful hunt are soon adapted to keep the bursas at bay.  "
52406, "Qui-Gon Jinn: These gundark attacks will continue until we stop them."
52407, "Qui-Gon Jinn: We must train warriors, then find and destroy the gundark nest."
52408, "Qui-Gon Jinn: But first, we need more workers.  Click on your Command Center..."
52409, "Click on your Command Center..."
52410, "Qui-Gon Jinn: ...now click on the Create Worker button."
52411, "Click on the Create Worker button"
52412, "Qui-Gon Jinn: While your worker is being created, set your other workers to harvest food and carbon."
52413, "Begin gathering food and carbon."
52414, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Be sure that Chewbacca doesn’t travel too far. He’ll need additional warriors to take on the gundarks in their lair."
52415, "Qui-Gon Jinn: If Chewbacca is killed, we’ll have to call off the mission."
52416, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Try creating another worker at your Command Center"
52417, "Qui-Gon Jinn: It appears you’ve run out of housing."
52418, "Qui-Gon Jinn: The Command Center houses five units. Every additional shelter you build allows you to increase your population by another five units."
52419, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You need to assemble some prefabricated shelters.  Click on a worker..."
52420, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You need to assemble some prefabricated shelters.  Click on a worker..."
52421, "Click on a worker..."
52422, "Qui-Gon Jinn: In the lower-left corner, click the Buildings button.  Then the Build Prefab Shelter button."
52423, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Then click on the ground where you want the shelter to be built."
52424, "Click on a worker, then click the Buildings button, then the Prefab Shelter button.  Then click on the ground where you want the shelter to go."
52425, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Good.  The more housing you build, the larger your population can grow."
52426, "Use one of your workers to build another Prefab Shelter. "
52427, "Qui-Gon Jinn: With all this construction, you’re probably running low on resources."
52428, "Qui-Gon Jinn: It’s time to build up your food stores.  I’ll teach you about hunting and herding."
52429, "Qui-Gon Jinn: If you’ve explored to the north, you’ve probably run across the docile creatures known as nerfs."
52430, "Qui-Gon Jinn: If you haven’t, you should explore in that direction now."
52431, "Explore the map and  find some nerfs."
52432, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Good, you’ve found some nerfs."
52433, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You can select and move them just like workers.  Move a few nerfs toward your Command Center."
52434, "Select and move some nerfs to your Command Center.  "
52435, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Now you can use your nerfs for food.  Click on a worker, and right-click on the nerf."
52436, "Click on a worker, then right-click on a nerf to gather food from it. "
52437, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You can gather food from certain WILD animals TOO... but you'll have to chase them down first."
52438, "Qui-Gon Jinn: We need more workers."
52439, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You don’t have to train them one at a time though."
52440, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Click on your Command Center...."
52441, "Click on the Command Center..."
52442, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Now you should create a Troop Center to provide you with warriors.  Click on a worker..."
52443, "Use a worker to build a Troop Center.  The Troop Center is a military building."
52444, "Qui-Gon Jinn: ... now click the Military Buildings button, then the Troop Center button."
52445, "Click on a worker, then the Buildings button, then the Build Power Core button."
52446, "Qui-Gon Jinn: If you click another worker, then right-click a building that is already under construction, he'll join in and speed up the building process. "
52447, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Good.  Now let’s build some fighting Wookiees."
52448, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Click on your troop center and click Create Trooper Recruit."
52449, "Click on your new Troop Center and click the Create Trooper Recruit button."
52450, "Qui-Gon Jinn: That's one Trooper Recruit. Let's train a few more."
52451, "Qui-Gon Jinn: But first, you need to know about power cores."
52452, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Your Command Center is self-powered, but other buildings require an external source of power to operate at full efficiency."
52453, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Without power, buildings operate at only 25% efficiency."
52454, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Click on a worker..."
52455, "Qui-Gon Jinn: ... then the Build button, then the Build Power Core button."
52456, "Click on a worker, then the Buildings button, then the Build Power Core button."
52457, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Then move your mouse over the map.  As you look for a place to put the power core, you can see the radius of power that it will supply.  Click on the ground where you want it to be built."
52458, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Good, you have a source of power."
52459, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Eh, by the way, is your troop center close enough to a power core?"
52460, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You can tell by looking at it.  A powered building features blinking lights."
52461, "Qui-Gon Jinn: If you need to power your troop center, you should build another power core closer to it."
52462, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Click on your troop center, then click on the Trooper Recruit button 4 times quickly."
52463, "Keep building trooper recruits until you have 5 or more."
52464, "Qui-Gon Jinn: When one recruit shows up, the next will begin training right away."
52465, "Qui-Gon Jinn: While you’re waiting for the rest of your troopers, look at the population indicator to the right of your resource bar. It shows how many units you currently have and how many your housing will support."
52466, "Qui-Gon Jinn: If it begins flashing, you’ve used up all your housing and you have to build more shelters."
52467, "Chewbacca:  Gruntt"
52468, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Chewbacca is young, and impatient for battle."
52469, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You’re almost done training warriors.  In the meantime, you can explore some more or create and assign more workers."
52470, "Qui-Gon Jinn: There's always something to do."
52471, "Qui-Gon Jinn: You’ve got a solid fighting force now.  It’s time to get rid of the gundark threat."
52472, "Qui-Gon Jinn: The gundarks are on the other side of the river."
52473, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Let us head north to find a crossing point."
52474, "Send Chewbacca and your warriors north to find and eliminate the gundarks."
52475, "Qui-Gon Jinn: That patchy section of the river is called a ford.  Your soldiers can walk right over it."
52476, "Battle Droid: More enemies approaching.  Destroy them."
52477, "Battle Droid: Roger roger."
52478, "Qui-Gon Jinn: They’re attacking!  We must defend ourselves!"
52479, "Create a fighting force, then find the gundark nest and destroy it. "
52480, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Trade Federation Battle Droids!  They’re wiping out the gundarks!"
52481, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Now click the create worker button 4 times quickly."
52482, "Train workers until you have nine total.  Keep harvesting food and carbon."
52483, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Don't forget: You'll need to harvest carbon too."
52484, "Qui-Gon Jinn: Excellent work!  The Trade Federation is a dangerous foe, and we certainly haven’t seen the last of them."
