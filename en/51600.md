51605, "The Empire may be on the run after its losses at Endor and Kashyyyk, but it can still inflict suffering on its former subjects.  In fact, it may have been less dangerous before we defeated it. \n\nThe situation on Kessel is chaotic.  The Imperial forces have shut down the air processors, and now they’re emptying all the storehouses of spice to bring to Coruscant. \n\nLocate and re-activate the air processing factories of Kessel before the prisoners run out of air..."
51606, "1. Build a strong force of Wookiee warriors as soon as you can.  The three Imperial detention centers that remain on the planet still have plenty of troopers to get in your way. \n\n2. Use Air Transports to drop workers off near air factories."
51607, "Build a Power Core at each of the air factories to bring them back online."
51608, "Lando:  We did it!  Plenty of fresh air to breathe now!"
51609, "Han:  Fresh air?  I've smelled better air in a trash compacter, old buddy."
51610, "Luke Skywalker:  What are we waiting for?  Let's rescue those prisoners!"
51611, "Han Solo:  Hey kid, if we don't get those air processors back on-line, there won't be any prisoners left to save."
51612, "Lando:  Relax, we'll get those air factories working again and free the prisoners.  Trust me."
51613, "Han Solo:  Where have I heard that before?"
51614, "Han:  That's one down...but we need the other three back in action or it won't matter much."
51615, "Han:  Why are there still so many Imperial troops on this planet?"
51616, "Lando:  They're here to make sure none of the prisoners get off the planet alive, I guess."
