15403, "Usually my buddy Han isn’t a guy to jump into hopeless crusades, but I think he’s going soft lately."
15404, "No sooner had they met with Weebacca, Han was agreeing to help them rebuild their Government Tree and contact the Republic."
15405, "All this despite the very high probability of Imperial involvement."
15406, "Come to think of it, he’s either going soft, or getting crazier."

15411, "I wouldn’t have believed it, but then again, I’ve never seen anything a Wookiee couldn’t build or fix, given enough grease and transmission wire."
15412, "But as with most of Han’s plans, the scheme to contact the Republic didn’t go quite as smoothly as it should have."

15414, "The Imperial communications jammers were working overtime to keep any signal to the Rebellion completely scrambled."
15415, "It was too dangerous to try and break the Imperial blockade with the Falcon, so Han hit on the brilliant plan of taking out the jammers himself."

15419, "The traitorous Weebacca escaped into the wilderness, and the Wookiee resistance narrowly escaped capture in their transports."
15420, "They had all been dealt quite a blow by the betrayal at Okikuti, and Chewie wanted revenge badly."

15434, "The Trandoshan slavers would never get another foothold under a strong Wookiee government, and that meant completely destroying a heavily-guarded Imperial Fortress."

15452, "I’m sure I broke a rib."
15453, "At any rate, Kashyyyk was free, after a long nightmare under the Empire and the Trandoshan slavers.  "
15454, "Chewie received a hero’s welcome, and I caught Han smiling proudly at him.  "

15470, "I have foreseen a great battle there, and want you to be prepared to secure my swift departure from the surface. "
15471, "I know you will not fail me, Sev'Rance."
15472, "The Republic has played into my hands on Geonosis.  While they lick their wounds from the battle, our new Confederacy alliance grows stronger. "
15473, "To shore up our position, we will need to strike back quickly."
15474, "And for that, I have something special in mind for you, Sev'Rance."
15475, "Message Encoded to Separatist Union, Count Dooku Transmitting."
15476, "Is there anyone in this Union who would say we have failed on Geonosis?  If so, you would be gravely mistaken.  "
15477, "While some might call the Geonosis incident a setback, I prefer to think of it as lulling the Jedi Council into a sense of  false confidence. No need to worry, my friends, the terrible financial burden you have placed upon your organizations for this cause shall not be in vain."
15478, "Even as we speak, Geonosian workers are hard at work constructing troops and ordinance.  And one of my finest generals, Sev'Rance Tann, is prepared to take delivery of these forces.  "
15479, "It is time for us to strike a critical blow to the Jedi Council and the heart of the Republic.  We shall be the instrument of their demise."
15480, "Excellent work, Sev'Rance. "
15481, "We now move into the next phase of my plan."
15482, "My esteemed colleagues, things are progressing well.  General Tann is bound for the Outer Rim world of Tatooine with our newly refitted forces."
15483, "As some of you are no doubt aware, Tatooine is controlled by a criminal organization known as the Hutt Cartel.  "
15484, "Sev'Rance Tann will go to Mos Osnoe and contact Boorka the Hutt, a crime boss who we believe possesses vital information regarding a new weapon being developed by the Republic."
15485, "I am confident my General will convince this Hutt to share his information with the Confederacy."
15486, "It seems the Republic is testing its new weapon on the inhospitable world of Eredenn Prime."
15487, "It is no surprise that they should choose such a desolate, remote location& so far away from any reinforcements they might hope to contact."
15488, "General Tann, I think it is time we brought our newly refit forces to bear on our enemies in the Erediss System."
15489, "General Tann has uncovered treachery on the part of the Republic - the location of a weapon's testing facility on the remote world of Eredenn Prime."
15490, "It is on this snowy, abandoned planet that they are testing a terrible new weapon, simply called the Decimator."
15491, "I have dispatched Sev'Rance to the Erediss system to investigate further.  We may find this new weapon useful for our cause."
15492, "Well done, Sev'Rance!"
15493, "So, the Wookiees are manufacturing the Decimator at their colony on Alaris Prime. They have long been pawns of the Republic.  "
15494, "Perhaps you know the old military saying that tells us to use greater strength against itself?  This weapon will serve that purpose for us."
15495, "Members of the Union, I have excellent news to report.  We have acquired the Decimator.  It is an extremely powerful weapon of war."
15496, "However, the Wookiees who engineered the Decimator included a failsafe locking mechanism which prevents us from using them."
15497, "General Tann is heading to Alaris Prime with a Data Droid containing the Decimator operational codes. "
15498, "Once there, she will need to escort the droid to the Decimator facilities so that it can interface with the main computer.  With the codes deciphered, the Decimators will be ours to utilize as we see fit."
15499, "You are exceeding my expectations, General."
