A decommissioned Imperial base lies south of your location. \n\nThe Rebels have had ample time to establish their army. They are likely sending troops and cargo ships out to raid the abundant food supplies. \n\nWe have lost contact with the food production facilities in the area, but they should still be active. If you reestablish contact, they will be able to supply your base."
