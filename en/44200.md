44205, "Our invasion has begun, but already a snag has materialized in our plan! A faulty commander droid has allowed the Naboo to make off with a droid control program. It resides in a research center near Harte Secur. \n\nIf they are allowed to duplicate the program, they may be able to turn our entire army against us! Find that control program, reactivate OOM-14's army, and destroy Harte Secur!"
44206, "1. Until the droid control program is back in our hands, we dare not commit a larger army to the assault. Use your limited forces wisely. \n\n2. The blaster cannon is a devastating anti-building weapon that must be undeployed to move and deployed to fire. Protect it from harm!"
44207, "Use your Neimoidian Technician to acquire the Droid Control Program from the Research Center on the central peninsula."

44213, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: We have deployed a technician with a special task force to reacquire the Droid Control Program."
44214, "Viceroy Nute Gunray:  You must protect the technician at all costs!"
44215, "Bring your Technician safely back to base to reactivate the Trade Federation army."
44216, "Viceroy Nute Gunray: Your droid army is reactivated."
44217, "Nute Gunray: Destroy Harte Secur!"
