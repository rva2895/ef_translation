54208, "The Trade Federation has an illegal mining operation on Krant's moon of Aereen. They have been supplying General Tann with resources to build the Confederacy its own Decimators on the surface below.\n\nEchuu must establish a base of operations on the moon from which to coordinate an invasion of Krant. But Echuu will need to be cautious, the Trade Federation has diverted much of its military to protect this facility - it will not be undefended."
54209, "1. The mining colony is heavily fortified.  You will need to establish a strong base and large army in order to succeed."
54210, "Destroy the main mining facilities."
54211, "[Optional] Destroy the secondary mining remotes."
54212, "Find and kill Plure Barron."

54228, "Echuu Shen-Jon and Naat Reath have been sent to Krant to shut down the Confederacy's Decimator production facilities. While still pursuing the elusive Sev'Rance Tann, Echuu and his small strike team must infiltrate the plant and destroy the factories before the Confederacy can produce the Decimator in mass."
54229, "1. Remember to use your troopers and Jedi with caution, as you won't have access to any production facilities to train replacement forces.\n\n2. The production facility is heavily defended with troops, mechs, fortresses and laser turrets. Anti-Air turrets prevent our Transports from providing you with any more units from orbit.  If you destroy those turret arrays, you will receive additional troops and other units."
54230, "Destroy every Decimator Factory."

54239, "The sprawling Decimator production facility lies to the northwest.  Scanners indicate that a number of unknown lifeforms and buildings may be found to the northeast of your landing site.  Sev'Rance Tann's personal ship is most likely parked at a launch pad, somewhere in the facility."

54248, "Against the Council's advice, General Shen-Jon has led his forces deeper into the Krantian forests in pursuit of Sev'Rance Tann and her captive, Naat Reath.\n\nDriven by his desire for revenge as much as his duty to rescue his Padawan learner, Echuu steps perilously close to the dark side."
54249, "1. Without any worker droids, you're going to have to do a bit of exploring to find some means of production.\n\n2. You won't be able to defeat the forces of Sev'Rance Tann with your starting army alone.  Be cautious bringing any military units too close to the heart of Tann's Fortress.  She may do something rash to Naat Reath if she sees a huge army bearing down on her.  She will most likely demand to face Echuu alone, and for Naat's sake, you will not have much choice."

54259, "The forest is crawling with Confederacy forces.  Two bases to the northeast and northwest provide some protection for Tann's fortress, which is not without defenses of its own.  Tann's Keep lies at the top of a barren island to the north, surrounded by a thicket of dead trees.  Scanners indicate structures to the west that appear to have been abandoned for some time."

Intelligence reports that this area of Coruscant is under the control of one of the Emperor's most feared Generals - Tal Ashen. Hand picked by the Emperor himself, he and his Elite Force are not to be trifled with."
54269, "1. You'll need to thoroughly understand the strengths and weaknesses of your team as well as the forces that are sent against you if you are to be successful."
54270, "Destroy the Elite Force and claim the Imperial Palace for the New Republic."

It is the opportunity the Empire has been looking for to capture them."
54289, "1. The Talors have had time to build a considerably large base on this planet.  Build up your forces in sufficient numbers before attempting a large scale attack."
54290, "Locate Rand and Kath Talor and their hidden base."
