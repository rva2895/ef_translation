15201, "Coming around, Rogue Leader."

15202, "Activate harpoon!"

15203, "Good shot, Jansen."

15204, "One more pass."

15205, "Detach cable."

15206, "Whooha!  That got him!"

15207, "Pilot Journal, Entry Thirty-Three and Six"

15208, "So much has happened since the Battle of Yavin, it’s all a blur to me."

15209, "We’ve been on the run constantly for several years, racing from planet to planet, searching for a safe haven."

15210, "For now, we’ve settled on Hoth, a hellish landscape of frozen dunes and snowdrifts.  At least it’s well-hidden."

15211, "Although our luck these days often seems short-lived."

15212, "A costly battle, and a frantic escape."

15213, "But the sacrifices of the Rebel ground forces made sure the transports escaped, and many Rebels likely avoided capture and torture by the Imperial invasion forces."

15214, "Excellent work."

15215, "Pilot Journal, Entry Thirty-Three and Seven"

15216, "We’ve been waiting a long time for this."

15217, "The Rebellion is poised to deal a crippling blow to the Empire, at an unassuming little planet called Endor."

15218, "A shield generator is located there, defending the new Death Star."

15219, "The generator must be destroyed."

15220, "Everything depends upon it."

15221, "I’m proud to say this is truly the first day of a New Republic, freed from the tyranny of the Empire forever."

15222, "We’re all gathered on the planet’s surface.  I can hear music and laughter drifting through the trees."

15223, "I can’t help but pause and take a long look at my friends: Luke, Han Solo, the Princess, Lando and all the other Rebels who fought long and hard in the trenches."

15224, "Guys like me, guys just doing their job."

15225, "And I can’t help feeling we’re all heroes now."

15226, "Pilot Journal, Entry Thirty-Three and Eight"

15227, "This scenario is presented as a bonus mission to test your skill."

15228, "It’s not looking good - the Empire has located one of our secret asteroid bases."

15229, "There will be no escape for the Rebellion this time."

15230, "Not even time for reinforcements."

15231, "Can we possibly win this time?"

15232, "Against all odds, we’ve won again.  Congratulations."

15234, "Naboo is a green-blue marble in space, my lord."

15235, "A peaceful planet barely able to resist our overwhelming forces."

15236, "It waits patiently for the Trade Federation's touch."

15237, "Queen Amidala and her people know nothing of our approach."

15238, "We will utterly dominate this planet in your name."

15244, "The subjugation of Parrlay is just the beginning of our invasion."

15245, "But a snag has materialized in the fabric of your plan, my lord."

15246, "There are five droid control programs down on Naboo with our initial landing force."

15247, "A droid control program is necessary for the large scale logistics of commanding a droid army."

15248, "Without it, a subset of our formidable Battle Droids stand motionless on the battlefield."

15249, "One of the droid control programs has been stolen by the pitiful Naboo."

15250, "This is a complication, but not a showstopper."

15251, "We will retrieve it at all costs."

15252, "End transmission."

15256, "Transmission 0302-CF  Location: Naboo  Encoded to Darth Sidious.  Viceroy Nute Gunray transmitting."

15257, "Lord Sidious, we have located Naboo's chief supply center."

15258, "It seems that all materials that are collected on Naboo are sent through this location."

15259, "Stored temporarily in Spaceports before being sent off-world."

15260, "Our blockade stops these resources from being transported away."

15261, "And thus their stockpiles must be overflowing."

15265, "The road between Spinnaker and Theed is not a long one."

15266, "There are very few settlements that we came across."

15267, "The ones that we did come across offered up little resistance to our droid armies."

15268, "We trampled over their dwellings with little care or respect."

15269, "After all, they are the defeated."

15283, "Rumors have been accumulating almost since we first set down on Naboo about intelligent creatures that escaped to the swamps and disappeared."

15284, "At first we ignored the rumors, instead choosing to concentrate on subjugating the Naboo on land."

15285, "But we can no longer turn a blind eye to this other civilization."

15286, "It is possibly more powerful than the Naboo, and so presents perhaps a greater threat."

15287, "It is time to squash the rumors once and for all. . ."

15292, "Transmission 0651-KP  Location: Naboo  Encoded to Darth Sidious.  Viceroy Nute Gunray transmitting."

15293, "So the rumors are true."

15294, "Gungans, denizens of the seas of Naboo are a new threat on this world."

15295, "What we once thought a peaceful world has turned into a combat zone, with enemies turning up at every corner."

15296, "With our Battle Droid army, we will smash the Gungans and other creatures that challenge us."

15297, "Naboo will ultimately belong entirely to the Trade Federation."

15298, "There is simply no other alternative."

15299, "End transmission."
