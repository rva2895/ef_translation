51203, "Ittummi Berserkers"
51204, "Even if the Rebels got the message, their fleet might be tied up on another mission.  They might even be on the run from some new Imperial loyalists. \n\nChewbacca knew how the Alliance worked, and he was unwilling to wait for results.  If Moff Darcc was the source of trouble on Kashyyyk, Chewie wanted to bring the fight directly to him. \n\nWe are near the palace of Moff Darcc. Build an army, smash his defenses, and reduce his palace to cinders!"
51205, "1. Imperials and Trandoshans have captured most of the Wookiee population of Chenachochan.  Liberate these survivors and they are certain to aid your cause. \n\n2. The Imperials are quickly losing their footing on Kashyyyk. Liberated Wookiee prisoners can take over nearby Imperial buildings. \n\n3. You'll need all of your army for this mission. Know the strengths of each unit!"
51206, "Congratulations!  "
51207, "You lost!!"
51208, "Chewbacca: RROAROROAROROR!"
51209, "Han Solo:  You're right, Chewie. "
51210, "Han Solo:  Let's see if we can find any survivors."
51211, "Village Elder: ROOARROROAAROR!"
51212, "Han Solo: A Palace, eh? This could be the place we're looking for."
51213, "Village Elder: RRROARORROAROR"
51214, "Han Solo: Pass me over those macrobinoculars, would you?"
51215, "Han Solo: This is crazy."
51216, "Chewbacca: ROOOARAROROAR!"
51217, "Destroy Moff Darcc’s Palace."
51218, "Villager: ROAROROAROAROORAR"
51219, "Han Solo: Berserkers, eh?"
51220, "Villager: RRRROAR!"
51221, "Han Solo:  We just need to go get them?"
51222, "Villager: RRRR!"
51223, "Han Solo:  Hey, I hope they're as effective as you say they are."
51224, "[Optional] Locate the Berserker tribe of Ittummi to aid in the Palace attack."
51225, "Ittummi Elder: RROARORORAROR!"
51226, "Han Solo: Never tell me the odds."
51227, "Build an army to storm the Palace."
51228, "Chewie: RORUAOURRR"
51229, "Han Solo: Did you hear that? "
51230, "Han Solo:  I wonder what's on the other side of this tree line."
51231, "Han Solo:  That thing looks impregnable."
51232, "Han Solo:  We're going to need a bigger army, THAT'S for sure!"
