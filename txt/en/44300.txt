The base has been heavily fortified in response to our invasion, however they are unaware of our efforts to reactivate our nearby base. \n\nTo the west is the Harte Secur Airbase.  The Naboo Airforce is not to be trifled with. Our information network indicates that this base harbors some of Naboo's most skilled pilots.  Deal with this base promptly upon recovery of the Droid Control Program!"
