60000, "Darth Vader: Destroy all Rebel military buildings."
60001, "Stormtrooper: Lord Vader, we are sending in reinforcements."
60002, "Stormtrooper: Lord Vader, more reinforcements are on the way."
60003, "Stormtrooper: My lord, we've spotted General Dodonna of the Rebels still on the surface."
60004, "Stormtrooper: He has retreated into a Massassi Temple."
60005, "Darth Vader: You must capture him at all costs."
60006, "Darth Vader: Is that a problem?"
60007, "Stormtrooper: No, Lord Vader."
60008, "Stormtrooper: We have recovered Dodonna's body, Lord Vader."
60009, "Darth Vader: Is he still alive?"
60010, "Stormtrooper: Barely."
60011, "Darth Vader: Use a mind probe on him."
60012, "Stormtrooper: We already have, my lord."
60013, "Stormtrooper: The probe uncovered evidence of a Rebel operation geared against Reytha."
60014, "Darth Vader: Reytha?"
60015, "Darth Vader: Pack up down there."
60016, "Darth Vader: We leave orbit in thirty minutes."
60017, "General Jan Dodonna: Fall back!"
60018, "General Jan Dodonna: The surprise is mine, bucketheads!"
60019, "Darth Vader: Hold your positions here."
60020, "Darth Vader: Make sure no one escapes."
60021, "Darth Vader: Once we take out their air defenses, I have a special surprise waiting for them."
60022, "Darth Vader: Establish a base."
60023, "Darth Vader: Destroy any existing structures."
60024, "Darth Vader: And destroy any existing Rebel structures."
60025, "Darth Vader: Destroy the Rebel Sentry Towers so they cannot alert the main base."
60026, "Reytha Governor: Lord Vader, this is Antes Belladar, the Governor of Reytha."
60027, "Darth Vader: Why have you summoned me, Governor?"
60028, "Reytha Governor: Supplies will keep deducting from our account until the cargo ships and their escorts can be stopped."
60029, "Reytha Governor: We must stop the Rebel Cargo Ships and their escorts."
60030, "Reytha Governor: Thank you!"
60031, "Reytha Soldier: Rebel Cargo Ships are stealing resources from our Spaceports."
60032, "Darth Vader: Target those Cargo Ships first."
60033, "Stormtrooper: Acknowledged, sir."
60034, "Darth Vader: They must not reach the main storehouses."
60035, "Darth Vader: Lieutenant, destroy all of the Rebels in the immediate area."
60036, "Stormtrooper: Yes, Lord Vader."
60037, "Stormtrooper: Lord Vader, we could retreat to Yeere."
60038, "Stormtrooper: There we could build up our forces for a counterattack."
60039, "Darth Vader: They are better defended than I thought."
60040, "Darth Vader: It is near the city of Yeere."
60041, "Darth Vader: There we should find an inactive Imperial Command Center."
60042, "Stormtrooper: If we capture the AquaHarvesters, our troops will have more supplies."
60043, "Darth Vader: This base helps to defend the airfield."
60044, "Stormtrooper: Lord Vader, we have discovered Reytha's AquaHarvester Station."
60045, "Darth Vader: Excellent, hold the area and reroute its resources to us."
60046, "Darth Vader: If we destroy them, the airfield will be an easier target."
60047, "Darth Vader: We have eliminated their power."
60048, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: Lord Vader, I had not hoped to see you again in this lifetime."
60049, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: Thank you."
60050, "Darth Vader: This should prove quite devastating to the Rebel Alliance."
60051, "Darth Vader: Gather your troops."
60052, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: I'll just need a few more minutes to finish."
60053, "Darth Vader: Once you complete your modifications, Colonel, we will test its destructive power on the Zalorians."
60054, "Darth Vader: We will destroy Zaloriis City in the name of the Empire."
60055, "Darth Vader: Is the prototype intact?"
60056, "General Maximilian Veers: They've destroyed it."
60057, "General Maximilian Veers: We'll never get past their defenses now."
60058, "Darth Vader: Veers has been captured by the Rebels."
60059, "Darth Vader: Commander, your failure will cost us dearly."
60060, "Stormtrooper: Our scientist have just researched Strengthened Frame."
60061, "Stormtrooper: It will make our heavy weapons stronger."
60062, "Stormtrooper: Our scientist have improved the frame by studying Reinforced Frame."
60063, "Stormtrooper: We have upgraded the Artillery."
60064, "Stormtrooper: We have upgraded the Mobile Missile Launcher."
60065, "Stormtrooper: Turreted defenses, Lord Vader."
60066, "Stormtrooper: At once, my lord."
60067, "Stormtrooper: Orders, sir?"
60068, "Zalor Militiaman: Lord Vader!"
60069, "Zalor Militiaman: The Rebel scum have raided our base."
60070, "Zalor Militiaman: They are escorting Colonel Veers back to Zaloriis."
60071, "Zalor Militiaman: I think they mean to put him on trial."
60072, "Zalor Militiaman: They will be heading through Katrain's Pass shortly."
60073, "Zalor Militiaman: If you hurry, you can cut them off."
60074, "Stormtrooper: We can still rescue him if we hurry."
60075, "Stormtrooper: Zaloriis City is in flames, Lord Vader."
60076, "Stormtrooper: We will destroy Zaloriis City in the name of the Empire."
60077, "Stormtrooper: We've been able to tap into the Rebel Alliance databank."
60078, "Stormtrooper: What have you found?"
60079, "Stormtrooper: Colonel Veers, we lost our supplies to the Rebels."
60080, "Stormtrooper: If we had 200 ore and 200 nova crystals, we could continue our research."
60081, "Stormtrooper: We have upgraded the Short Ranged Ram."
60082, "Darth Vader: We need to advance to the Imperial Fondor II base."
60083, "Darth Vader: There we will reactivate the base and launch our counterattack."
60084, "Darth Vader: Very well."
60085, "General Maximilian Veers: Lord Vader, we must get back to Zaloriis City."
60086, "General Maximilian Veers: Here it is, the All Terrain Armored Transport.  AT-AT for short."
60087, "General Maximilian Veers: It's only a prototype, but it has proven to be quite lethal."
60088, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: If we can get this prototype back to Fondor II, my men can finish installing the remaining weapons."
60089, "General Maximilian Veers: It is safely hidden, my lord."
60090, "Colonel Maximilian Veers: My troops had orders to take it to a secret base near the Fantain mountains."
60091, "General Maximilian Veers: I'll lead you there."
60092, "General Maximilian Veers: Orders, sir?"
60093, "Darth Vader: General Veers?"
60094, "Darth Vader: General, you are delaying too long."
60095, "General Maximilian Veers: That's got it."
60096, "Darth Vader: Excellent work, General."
60097, "Darth Vader: All the Shield Generators are now off-line."
60098, "General Maximilian Veers: At once, Lord Vader!"
60099, "General Maximilian Veers: I'm within range, Lord Vader."
