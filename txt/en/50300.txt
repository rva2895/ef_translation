50390, "The Empire is building up quickly on a nearby asteroid. Scanners indicate that a strike force is on its way even now. \n\nIn the early years of the Rebellion, low-atmosphere farming had yet to be developed. You will have to make do with bitter-tasting mynocks and the food generated at your nursery. \n\nDue to the lack of vegetation, we are forced to extract carbon from the asteroid itself. Exploit the carbon rocks around your base, but be aware that they are tapped out quickly."
